MAT|1|1||The book of the nativity of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, son of Abraham.
MAT|1|2||Abraham begat Isaac: Isaac begat Jacob: Jacob begat Judah and his brothers:
MAT|1|3||Judah begat Pharez and Zara of Tamar: Pharez begat Hezron: Hezron begat Ram:
MAT|1|4||Ram begat Aminadab: Aminadab begat Nahshon: Nahshon begat Salmon:
MAT|1|5||Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab: Boaz begat Obed of Ruth: Obed begat Jesse:
MAT|1|6||Jesse begat David the king: David begat Solomon of the wife of Uriah:
MAT|1|7||Solomon begat Rehoboam: Rehoboam begat Abia: Abia begat Asa:
MAT|1|8||Asa begat Jehoshaphat: Jehoshaphat begat Joram: Joram begat Uzziah:
MAT|1|9||Uzziah begat Jotham: Jotham begat Ahaz: Ahaz begat Hezekiah:
MAT|1|10||Hezekiah begat Manasseh: Manasseh begat Amon: Amon begat Josiah:
MAT|1|11||Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brothers, in the captivity of Babylon.
MAT|1|12||And after the captivity of Babylon, Jeconiah begat Salathiel: Salathiel begat Zerubbabel:
MAT|1|13||Zerubbabel begat Abiud: Abiud begat Eliakim: Eliakim begat Azor:
MAT|1|14||Azor begat Zadok: Zadok begat Achim: Achim begat Eliud:
MAT|1|15||Eliud begat Eleazar: Eleazar begat Matthan: Matthan begat Jacob:
MAT|1|16||Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called the Messiah.
MAT|1|17||All the generations, therefore, are, from Abraham to David fourteen generations, and from David to the captivity of Babylon fourteen generations, and from the captivity of Babylon to the Messiah fourteen generations.
MAT|1|18||And the birth of Jesus the Messiah was thus. While his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they had cohabited, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
MAT|1|19||And Joseph her husband was a righteous man, and unwilling to expose her: and he thought of putting her away privately.
MAT|1|20||And while he contemplated these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said to him: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her, is from the Holy Spirit:
MAT|1|21||and she will bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he will resuscitate his people from their sins.
MAT|1|22||Now all this that occurred, was to fulfill what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet:
MAT|1|23||Behold, a virgin will conceive, and will bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted, Our God with us.
MAT|1|24||And when Joseph rose from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife.
MAT|1|25||And he knew her not, until she had borne her firstborn son, and called is name Jesus.
MAT|2|1||Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, there came Magi from the east unto Jerusalem,
MAT|2|2||saying: Where is the king of the Jews that is born? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.
MAT|2|3||And Herod the king heard, and he was disturbed; and all Jerusalem with him.
MAT|2|4||And he assembled all the chiefs of the priests and the scribes of the people, and inquired of them, Where is the birthplace of the Messiah?
MAT|2|5||And they said: In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written in the prophet:
MAT|2|6||Thou also, Bethlehem of Judaea, art not the little among the kings of Judaea, for a king shall come from thee who shall rule my people Israel.
MAT|2|7||Then Herod privately called the Magi, and learned from them at what time the star appeared to them.
MAT|2|8||And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said to them, Go, search diligently for the child; and when ye have found him, come and tell me, that I also may go and worship him.
MAT|2|9||And they, when they had heard from the king, went forward: and lo, the star they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
MAT|2|10||And when they saw the star, they rejoiced much, with great joy.
MAT|2|11||And they entered the house; and they saw the child, with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him: and they opened their treasures, and presented to him gifts, gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
MAT|2|12||And it was shown them in a dream, that they should not return to Herod. And by another way, they returned to their country.
MAT|2|13||And when they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt; and be thou there, until I tell thee: for Herod will seek for the child, to destroy it.
MAT|2|14||Then Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, by night, and fled to Egypt.
MAT|2|15||And he was there, until the death of Herod; that so might be fulfilled that which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, From Egypt have I called my son.
MAT|2|16||Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deluded by the Magi, was very angry. And he sent and slew all the children in Bethlehem, and in all its confines, from a child of two years and under, according to the time that he had carefully learned from the Magi.
MAT|2|17||Then was that fulfilled, which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
MAT|2|18||A voice was heard in Rama, weeping and great lamentation; Rachel bemoaning her children, and unwilling to be comforted, because they are no more.
MAT|2|19||But when king Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
MAT|2|20||and said to him: Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the life of the child.
MAT|2|21||And Joseph arose, and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
MAT|2|22||But when he heard that Archelaus was king in Judaea, instead of his father Herod, he feared to go thither. And it was revealed to him in a dream, that he should go into the land of Galilee.
MAT|2|23||And he came and dwelt in a city that is called Nazareth: that so might be fulfilled that which was said by the prophet, that he should be called a Nazarene.
MAT|3|1||And in those days came John the Baptizer. And he proclaimed in the desert of Judaea,
MAT|3|2||and said: Repent; the kingdom of heaven hath approached.
MAT|3|3||For this is he of whom it was said, by Isaiah the prophet: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make smooth his paths.
MAT|3|4||And as to this John, his raiment was of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin was upon his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
MAT|3|5||Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country about the Jordan.
MAT|3|6||And they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, while they confessed their sins.
MAT|3|7||But when he saw many of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, who came to be baptized, he said to them: Generation of vipers, who hath taught you to flee from the wrath that cometh?
MAT|3|8||Bring forth the fruits therefore, that accord with repentance.
MAT|3|9||And do not think, and say within yourselves, that Abraham is our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
MAT|3|10||And lo, the ax is put to the root of trees. Every tree, therefore, which beareth not good fruit, is felled, and falleth into the fire.
MAT|3|11||I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is more powerful than I; whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
MAT|3|12||His winnowing shovel is in his hand; and he will make clean his threshing-floor. The wheat he will gather into his storehouse; and the chaff he will burn with fire not extinguished.
MAT|3|13||Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized by him.
MAT|3|14||But John refused him; and said, I need to be baptized by thee, and hast thou come to me?
MAT|3|15||And Jesus answered, and said to him: Allow it now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted him.
MAT|3|16||And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water. And heaven was opened to him; and he saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove, and it came upon him.
MAT|3|17||And lo, a voice from heaven, which said: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have delight.
MAT|4|1||Then was Jesus led by the Holy Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the Calumniator
MAT|4|2||And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he hungered.
MAT|4|3||And the Tempter came, and said to him: If thou art the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.
MAT|4|4||But he replied, and said: It is written, that not by bread only, doth man live; but by every word proceeding from the mouth of God.
MAT|4|5||Then the Calumniator took him to the holy city, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,
MAT|4|6||and said to him: If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, that he will give his angels charge of thee, and in their hands will they sustain thee, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone.
MAT|4|7||Jesus said to him: It is moreover written, that thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
MAT|4|8||Again the Calumniator took him to a mountain that was very high, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
MAT|4|9||and said to him: All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
MAT|4|10||Then Jesus said to him: Begone, Satan; for it is written, that thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; and him only shalt thou serve.
MAT|4|11||Then the Calumniator left him: and lo, angels came, and ministered to him.
MAT|4|12||And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired to Galilee.
MAT|4|13||And he left Nazareth, and came and dwelt in Capernaum, by the side of the sea, on the confines of Zebulon and Naphthali.
MAT|4|14||That so might be fulfilled that which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, who said:
MAT|4|15||The land of Zebulon, the land of Naphthali, the way of the sea, the ford of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
MAT|4|16||the people that sat in darkness, have seen great light; and to them who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is arisen.
MAT|4|17||From that time began Jesus to proclaim and say: Repent; for the kingdom of heaven hath approached.
MAT|4|18||And as he walked on the shore of the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Cephas, and Andrew his brother, who were casting nets into the sea; for they were fishermen.
MAT|4|19||And Jesus said to them: Follow me; and I will cause you to become fishers of men.
MAT|4|20||And immediately, they left their nets, and went after him.
MAT|4|21||And as he passed on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, who were mending their nets. And Jesus called them.
MAT|4|22||And they immediately left the ship and their father, and went after him.
MAT|4|23||And Jesus traveled over all Galilee. and he taught in their synagogues and proclaimed the tidings of the kingdom; and he cured every disease and malady among the people.
MAT|4|24||And his fame spread through all Syria. And they brought to him all them that were very sick with diverse diseases, and them that were afflicted with pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics and paralytics; and he healed them.
MAT|4|25||And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee, and from the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.
MAT|5|1||And when Jesus saw the multitudes, he ascended a hill; and when he was seated, his disciples drew near him:
MAT|5|2||and he opened his mouth, and taught them, and said:
MAT|5|3||Blessed are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
MAT|5|4||Blessed are the mourners: for they shall be comforted!
MAT|5|5||Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth!
MAT|5|6||Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be satiated!
MAT|5|7||Blessed are the merciful: for on them shall be mercies!
MAT|5|8||Blessed are the clean in heart: for they shall behold God!
MAT|5|9||Blessed are the cultivators of peace: for they shall be called sons of God!
MAT|5|10||Blessed are they that are persecuted on account of righteousness: for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!
MAT|5|11||Blessed are ye, when they revile you and persecute you, and speak every evil thing against you, falsely, on my account.
MAT|5|12||At that time, rejoice and be glad: for your reward in heaven is great. For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you.
MAT|5|13||Ye are the salt of the earth! But if the salt become insipid, with what shall it be seasoned? It is fit for nothing; but to be thrown out, and be trodden under foot by men.
MAT|5|14||Ye are the light of the world! A city built upon a hill, cannot be concealed.
MAT|5|15||And they do not light a lamp and place it under a bushel; but upon a lightstand, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.
MAT|5|16||Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who is in heaven.
MAT|5|17||Do not suppose that I have come to subvert the law or the prophets: [I have come] not to subvert, but to fulfill.
MAT|5|18||For verily I say to you, that until heaven and earth shall pass away, one iota or one letter shall not pass from the law, until all shall be fulfilled.
MAT|5|19||Therefore whoever shall break one of these small commands and shall so inculcate on the children of men, shall be called little in the kingdom of heaven: but every one that shall do and teach [them], shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|5|20||For I say to you, that unless your righteousness shall abound more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|5|21||Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill: and every one that killeth, is obnoxious to judgment.
MAT|5|22||But I say to you, That every one who is angry with his brother rashly, is obnoxious to judgment: and every one that saith to his brother, Raka! is obnoxious to the council: and every one that shall say, Fool is obnoxious to hell-fire.
MAT|5|23||If therefore thou shalt bring thy oblation to the altar, and shalt there remember that thy brother hath any offence against thee,
MAT|5|24||leave there thy oblation before the altar, and go first and be reconciled with thy brother; and then come and present thy oblation.
MAT|5|25||Be at agreement with thy prosecutor, forthwith, and while on the way with him; lest the prosecutor deliver thee up to the judge, and the Judge deliver thee over to the sheriff, and thou fall into the house of prisoners.
MAT|5|26||Verily I say to thee, Thou wilt not come out from there until thou hast paid the last farthing.
MAT|5|27||Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.
MAT|5|28||But I say to you, That whoever gazeth on a woman with concupiscence, at once committeth adultery with her in his heart.
MAT|5|29||If therefore thy right eye make thee offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; because it is better for thee that thy one member perish, than that thy whole body fall into hell.
MAT|5|30||And if thy right hand make thee offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee; because it is better for thee that one of thy members perish, than that thy whole body fall into hell.
MAT|5|31||It hath been said, That if a man will put away his wife, he must give her a writing of divorcement.
MAT|5|32||But I say to you, That whoever putteth away his wife, except for the offence of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and he that taketh the divorced woman, committeth adultery.
MAT|5|33||Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not be false in thy oaths; but thou shalt perform thine oaths to the Lord.
MAT|5|34||But I say to you, Swear not at all: not by heaven, for it is the throne of God:
MAT|5|35||and not by the earth, for it is the footstool under his feet: and likewise not by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
MAT|5|36||Moreover, thou shalt not swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair in it either black or white.
MAT|5|37||But let your language be, Yes, yes; or No, no; for whatever is beyond these proceedeth from evil.
MAT|5|38||Ye have heard that it hath been said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
MAT|5|39||But I say to you: Resist not evil; but if a person smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
MAT|5|40||And if one is disposed to sue thee and get away thy coat, relinquish to him also thy cloak.
MAT|5|41||Whoever compelleth thee to go one mile, go with him two.
MAT|5|42||Whoever demandeth of thee, give to him: and whoever wisheth to borrow of thee, deny him not.
MAT|5|43||Ye have heard that it hath been said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy.
MAT|5|44||But I say to you: Love your enemies; and bless him that curseth you; and do good to him that hateth you; and pray for them that lead you in bonds, and that persecute you:
MAT|5|45||that ye may be the children of your Father that is in heaven, who causeth his sun to rise upon the good and upon the bad, and sendeth his rain upon the righteous and upon the unrighteous.
MAT|5|46||For, if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans do this?
MAT|5|47||And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye that is not common? Do not even publicans do this?
MAT|5|48||Be ye therefore perfect; even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
MAT|6|1||Be cautious in your alms-giving, not to perform it before men, so that ye may be seen of them: otherwise, ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
MAT|6|2||Therefore, when thou doest alms thou shalt not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get praise from men. Verily I say to you, They have gotten their reward.
MAT|6|3||But thou, when doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
MAT|6|4||that thy alms may be in secret. And thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
MAT|6|5||And when thou prayest. thou shalt not be like the hypocrites, who are fond of standing up in the synagogues and at the corners of streets to pray, so that they may be seen by people. Verily I say to you, they have gotten their reward.
MAT|6|6||But thou, when thou prayest enter into thy closet and close the door, and pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
MAT|6|7||And when ye pray, be not garrulous like the heathen; for they expect to be heard for their abundance of words.
MAT|6|8||Therefore, be not like them; for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before ye ask him.
MAT|6|9||In this manner, therefore, pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name:
MAT|6|10||Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done; as in heaven, so on earth:
MAT|6|11||Give us our needful bread, this day:
MAT|6|12||And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors:
MAT|6|13||And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever: Amen.
MAT|6|14||For if ye forgive men their faults, your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you.
MAT|6|15||But if ye shall not forgive men, your Father also forgiveth not you your faults.
MAT|6|16||And when ye fast, be not sad like the hypocrites. For they distort their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say to you, they have gotten their reward.
MAT|6|17||But, when thou fastest, wash thou thy face, and anoint thy head:
MAT|6|18||that thou mayest not be seen by men as a faster, but by thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will recompense thee.
MAT|6|19||Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust spoil, and where thieves dig through and steal.
MAT|6|20||But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where no moth and no rust can spoil, and no thieves dig through nor steal.
MAT|6|21||For where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.
MAT|6|22||The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore thy eye shall be sound, thy whole body will be luminous.
MAT|6|23||But if thy eye shall be diseased, thy whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in thee be darkness, how great will be thy darkness!
MAT|6|24||No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will honor the one and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
MAT|6|25||Therefore I say to you: Be not anxious about your life, what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink; nor about your body, how ye shall clothe yourselves. Is not the life more important than food, and the body than raiment?
MAT|6|26||Look at the birds of heaven; which sow not, and reap not, and gather not into storehouses, but your Father who is in heaven feedeth them. Are not ye more important than they?
MAT|6|27||And who of you that shall be anxious, can add to his stature a cubit?
MAT|6|28||And about raiment, why are ye anxious? Consider the lilies of the desert, in what manner they grow. They toil not; and they spin not.
MAT|6|29||Yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory, was arrayed like one of them.
MAT|6|30||And if God so clothe the grass of the field, which exists to-day, and tomorrow falls into the oven, will he not much more [clothe] you, ye small in faith?
MAT|6|31||Therefore be not anxious; nor say, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink; or wherewith be clothed?
MAT|6|32||For, all these things the people of the world seek after. And your Father, who is in heaven, knoweth that all these things are needful to you.
MAT|6|33||But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness: and all these things shall be added to you.
MAT|6|34||Therefore be not anxious about the morrow: for the morrow hath its own anxieties. Sufficient for the day, is its own evil.
MAT|7|1||Judge not, that ye be not judged.
MAT|7|2||For with the judgment that ye judge, ye shall be judged; and by the measure that ye measure, shall it be measured to you.
MAT|7|3||And why observest thou the straw in thy brother's eye, and regardest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
MAT|7|4||Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Allow me to pluck the straw from thy eye; and lo! a beam is in thy own eye.
MAT|7|5||Thou hypocrite; pluck first the beam from thy own eye; and then thou wilt see clearly, to pluck the straw out of thy brother's eye.
MAT|7|6||Give not a holy thing to dogs: and cast not your pearls before swine; lest they tread them under their feet, and turn and lacerate you.
MAT|7|7||Ask, and it shall be given to you: seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.
MAT|7|8||For, every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
MAT|7|9||For what man is there among you, of whom if his son ask bread, will he reach him a stone?
MAT|7|10||Or if he ask of him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?
MAT|7|11||If ye then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
MAT|7|12||Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you; so also do ye to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
MAT|7|13||Enter ye in by the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad the way which leadeth to destruction; and many are they that walk in it.
MAT|7|14||How small the gate and straitened the way that leadeth to life, and few they who find it!
MAT|7|15||Beware of false prophets; who come to you in the garb of sheep, but internally they are rapacious wolves.
MAT|7|16||And from their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes; or figs from thistles?
MAT|7|17||So every good tree beareth good fruits; but a bad tree beareth bad fruits.
MAT|7|18||A good tree cannot bear bad fruits; nor can a bad tree bear good fruits.
MAT|7|19||Every tree that beareth not good fruits, is cut down and consigned to the fire.
MAT|7|20||Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.
MAT|7|21||Not whoever may say to me, My Lord, my Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|7|22||Many will say to me in that day, My Lord, my Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name cast out demons? and in thy name wrought many works of power?
MAT|7|23||And then will I declare to them; I never knew you. Depart from me, ye doers of evil.
MAT|7|24||Every one therefore that heareth these my discourses, and doeth them, will be like to a wise man, one that built his house upon a rock.
MAT|7|25||And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew; and they rushed upon that house; and it fell not, for its foundations were laid upon a rock.
MAT|7|26||And every one that heareth these my discourses, and doeth them not, will be like a foolish man that built his house upon sand.
MAT|7|27||And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew; and they rushed upon that house, and it fell; and great was the ruin of it.
MAT|7|28||And so it was, that when Jesus had ended these discourses, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
MAT|7|29||for he taught them as one having authority; and not as their Scribes and Pharisees.
MAT|8|1||And as he descended from the mountain, great multitudes gathered around him.
MAT|8|2||And behold, a leper came and worshipped him, and said: My Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
MAT|8|3||And Jesus stretched forth his hand, touched him, and said: I will: be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
MAT|8|4||And Jesus said to him, See, thou tell no man: but go, show thyself to the priests, and present an oblation as Moses enjoined, for a testimony to them.
MAT|8|5||And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, and besought him,
MAT|8|6||and said: My Lord, my child lieth at home and is paralytic, and badly afflicted.
MAT|8|7||Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.
MAT|8|8||The centurion replied, and said: My Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my child will be healed.
MAT|8|9||For I also am a man under authority, and there are soldiers under my hands, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this thing, and he doeth [it].
MAT|8|10||And when Jesus heard [this], he admired [it]; and he said to those walking with him, Verily I say to you, I have not found faith like this even in Israel.
MAT|8|11||And I say to you, that many shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
MAT|8|12||but the children of the kingdom shall go forth into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|8|13||And Jesus said to the centurion. Go; be it to thee as thou hast believed. And his child was cured in that same hour.
MAT|8|14||And Jesus came to the house of Simon and saw his wife's mother prostrate, confined by a fever.
MAT|8|15||And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose and ministered to them.
MAT|8|16||And when it was evening, they brought many demoniacs before him; and he expelled their demons by a word, and healed all them that were diseased:
MAT|8|17||that so might be fulfilled that which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, who said: He will bear our sorrows, and our infirmities he will take upon him.
MAT|8|18||And when Jesus saw great multitudes, around him, he ordered that they should go to the opposite shore.
MAT|8|19||And a Scribe came and said to him: Rabbi, I will follow thee to the place whither thou goest.
MAT|8|20||Jesus said to him, For foxes there are holes, and for the birds of heaven there are nests; but for the Son of man, there is not where he may recline his head.
MAT|8|21||And another of his disciples said to him: My Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
MAT|8|22||But Jesus said to him: Follow thou me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.
MAT|8|23||And when Jesus entered the ship, his disciples embarked with him.
MAT|8|24||And lo, a great commotion arose in the sea, so that the vessel was covered by the waves. But Jesus was asleep:
MAT|8|25||and his disciples came to awake him, and said to him: Our Lord, deliver us; we are perishing!
MAT|8|26||Jesus said to them, Why are ye afraid, ye small in faith! Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the sea; and there was great tranquillity.
MAT|8|27||And the men were amazed; and they said, What a man is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient!
MAT|8|28||And when Jesus arrived at the farther shore, in the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs, who came out from the sepulchres, very furious, so that no one could pass that way.
MAT|8|29||And they cried out, and said: What have we to do with thee? Jesus, thou Son of God. Hast thou come hither before the time to torment us?
MAT|8|30||And at a distance from them there was a herd of many swine feeding
MAT|8|31||And the demons entreated of him, and said: If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.
MAT|8|32||And Jesus said to them, Go ye. And immediately they came out, and entered into the swine; and that whole herd ran straight to a precipice and plunged into the sea, and perished in the waters.
MAT|8|33||And the herdsmen fled, and entered the city, and related all that had occurred, and concerning the demoniacs.
MAT|8|34||And all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him to retire from their coasts.
MAT|9|1||And he entered the ship, and passed over and came to his own city.
MAT|9|2||And they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus saw their faith, and said to the paralytic: Take courage, my son; thy sins are forgiven thee.
MAT|9|3||And some of the Scribes said in their minds, This man blasphemeth.
MAT|9|4||But Jesus knew their thoughts: and he said to them, Why do ye think evil [things] in your heart?
MAT|9|5||For, which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
MAT|9|6||But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic: Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy home.
MAT|9|7||And he arose and went to his home.
MAT|9|8||And when the multitudes saw [it], they were struck with awe; and they praised God, who had given authority like this to men.
MAT|9|9||And as Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man sitting at the custom-house, whose name was Matthew. And he said to him, Follow me: and he arose and followed him.
MAT|9|10||And as they were reclining in a house, many publicans an sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
MAT|9|11||And when the Pharisees saw [it] they said to his disciples, Why doth your Rabbi eat with publicans and sinners?
MAT|9|12||And as Jesus heard [it], he said to them: They who are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are very sick.
MAT|9|13||Go and learn what that is: I require compassion, and not a sacrifice! For I did not come to call the righteous, but the sinful.
MAT|9|14||Then came to him the disciples of John, and said: Why do we and the Pharisees fast much and thy disciples fast not?
MAT|9|15||Jesus said to them: Can the children of the nuptial chamber fast, so long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
MAT|9|16||No one inserteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; lest that which filleth up, tear from that garment, and the rent become greater.
MAT|9|17||And they do not put new wine into old sacks; lest the sacks burst, and the wine run out, and the sacks perish. But they put new wine into new sacks and they are both preserved.
MAT|9|18||And while he was thus discoursing with them a certain ruler came, drew near, worshipped him and said: My daughter is already dead, but come lay thy hand upon her, and she will live.
MAT|9|19||And Jesus rose up, and his disciples; and they followed him.
MAT|9|20||And behold, a woman whose blood had flowed fourteen years, came up behind him, and touched the extremity of his robe:
MAT|9|21||for she had said in her mind, If I but touch his garment I shall be cured.
MAT|9|22||And Jesus turned himself, looked at her, and said to her: Take courage, my daughter; thy faith hath given thee life. And the woman was cured from that very hour.
MAT|9|23||And Jesus came to the house of the ruler: and he saw there pipers, and multitudes making outcry.
MAT|9|24||And he said to them: Retire; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they scoffed at him.
MAT|9|25||And when he had ejected the throngs, he entered in, and took her by the hand, and the maid rose up.
MAT|9|26||And the fame of this [thing] spread in all that land.
MAT|9|27||And when Jesus had passed from there, two blind men followed after him, and said: Have mercy on us, Thou Son of David!
MAT|9|28||And when he had entered a house, those blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them: Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, our Lord.
MAT|9|29||Then he touched their eyes, and said: As ye have believed, so shall it be to you.
MAT|9|30||And forthwith their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them and said: See, that no man know [of it].
MAT|9|31||But they went out and spread the fame of it in all that land.
MAT|9|32||And as Jesus went out, they brought to him a dumb man in whom was a demon.
MAT|9|33||And when the demon had gone out, the dumb man conversed. And the multitudes admired, and said: Never was it so seen in Israel!
MAT|9|34||But the Pharisees said: It is by the Prince of demons, he casteth out demons.
MAT|9|35||And Jesus traveled over all the cities and the villages: and he taught in their synagogues, and proclaimed the tidings of the kingdom, and healed all diseases and all pains.
MAT|9|36||And when Jesus looked on the multitudes, he pitied them; because they were wearied and dispersed, like sheep that have no shepherd.
MAT|9|37||And he said to his disciples, The harvest is great, and the laborers few.
MAT|9|38||Entreat, therefore, of the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers into his harvest.
MAT|10|1||And he called his twelve disciples [to him], and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal every pain and disease.
MAT|10|2||And the names of those twelve Legates are these: The first of them, Simon who is called Cephas, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
MAT|10|3||and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Thomas, and Matthew the publican; and James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was called Thaddeus;
MAT|10|4||and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed him.
MAT|10|5||These twelve Jesus sent forth: and he commanded them and said: Go not in the way of the Gentiles: and enter not the cities of the Samaritans.
MAT|10|6||But, go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
MAT|10|7||And as ye go, proclaim and say: The kingdom of heaven hath approached.
MAT|10|8||Heal ye the sick; cleanse the leprous; [raise the dead;] and cast out demons. Freely ye have received; freely give.
MAT|10|9||Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
MAT|10|10||nor a wallet for the journey: neither two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff. For the laborer is worthy of his food.
MAT|10|11||And into whatever city or town ye enter, inquire, who in it is worthy; and there stay until ye depart.
MAT|10|12||And when ye enter a house, salute the household.
MAT|10|13||And if the house be worthy, your peace will come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace will return upon yourselves.
MAT|10|14||And whoever will not receive you, nor hear your discourses, when ye depart from that house or that town, shake off the dust from your feet.
MAT|10|15||Verily I say to you, that it will be comfortable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, rather than for that city.
MAT|10|16||Behold, I send you forth as sheep among wolves. Therefore be ye sagacious as serpents, and guileless as doves.
MAT|10|17||And beware of men; for they will deliver you over to the tribunals, and will scourge you in their synagogues.
MAT|10|18||And they will bring you before governors and kings, on my account, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
MAT|10|19||And when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that hour what to say.
MAT|10|20||For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your Father speaking in you.
MAT|10|21||And brother shall deliver up his brother to death, and a father his son; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to die.
MAT|10|22||And ye shall be hated by every one, on account of my name. But he that shall endure to the end, shall have life.
MAT|10|23||And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another: for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have completed all the cities of the house of Israel, till the Son of man shall come.
MAT|10|24||No disciple is better than his rabbi; nor a servant, than his lord.
MAT|10|25||It is sufficient for the disciple, that he be as his rabbi; and the servant, as his lord. If they call the lord of the house Beelzebub, how much more the children of his family?
MAT|10|26||Therefore be not afraid of them; for there is nothing covered up, that shall not be exposed; nor concealed, that shall not become known.
MAT|10|27||Whatever I say to you in the dark, that speak ye in the light; and what ye have heard in your ears, proclaim ye on the housetops.
MAT|10|28||And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but be afraid rather of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
MAT|10|29||Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? Yet one of them doth not fall to the ground without your Father.
MAT|10|30||As for you, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
MAT|10|31||Therefore be not afraid: ye are more important than many sparrows.
MAT|10|32||Wherefore, whoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|10|33||But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|10|34||Think not that I have come to sow quietness on the earth: I have not come to sow quietness, but conflict.
MAT|10|35||For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
MAT|10|36||And a man's foes will be the members of his household.
MAT|10|37||He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me:
MAT|10|38||and he that doth not bear his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
MAT|10|39||He that preserveth his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall preserve it.
MAT|10|40||He that entertaineth you, entertaineth me: and he that entertaineth me, entertaineth him that sent me.
MAT|10|41||He that entertaineth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward: and he that entertaineth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.
MAT|10|42||And whoever shall give one of these little ones to drink a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
MAT|11|1||And when Jesus had ended the instructions to his twelve disciples, he went from there, to teach and to proclaim in their cities.
MAT|11|2||Now when John, in the house of prisoners, heard of the works of Messiah, he sent by the hand of his disciples,
MAT|11|3||and said to him: Art thou he that cometh, or are we to expect another?
MAT|11|4||Jesus answered, and said to them: Go, tell John the things that ye hear and see:
MAT|11|5||the blind see, and the lame walk, and the leprous are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead rise up, and the needy hear good tidings:
MAT|11|6||and happy is he, who shall not be stumbled at me.
MAT|11|7||And when they were gone, Jesus began to say to the multitudes, concerning John: What went ye into the wilderness to see? A reed that waved in the wind?
MAT|11|8||And if not; what went ye out to see? A man clothed in delicate robes? Lo, they that are clothed in delicate [robes], are in the dwelling of kings.
MAT|11|9||And if not; what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yes, say I to you, and more than a prophet.
MAT|11|10||For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, that he may prepare the way before thee.
MAT|11|11||Verily I say to you, Among those born of women, there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptizer: yet the small one in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.
MAT|11|12||And from the days of John the Baptizer, until now, the kingdom of heaven is assailed by force, and the violent seize it.
MAT|11|13||For all the prophets and the law prophesied, until the time of John.
MAT|11|14||And, if ye are willing, receive ye, that this is he who was to come.
MAT|11|15||He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!
MAT|11|16||But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like to children, that sit in the marketplace and call to their associates,
MAT|11|17||and say: We have sung to you, and ye did not dance: we have wailed to you, and ye did not lament.
MAT|11|18||For John came, not eating and not drinking; and they said, He hath a demon.
MAT|11|19||The Son of man came, eating and drinking; and they say: Behold, a gluttonous man, and a wine drinker, and a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her works.
MAT|11|20||Then began Jesus to reproach the cities, in which his many deeds of power were wrought, yet they repented not.
MAT|11|21||And he said: Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, doubtless, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.
MAT|11|22||But I say to you, It will be comfortable for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judgment, rather than for you.
MAT|11|23||And thou, Capernaum, which hast been lifted up to heaven, shalt be brought down to the grave. For if those deeds of power which were done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have stood to this day.
MAT|11|24||But I say to thee, It will be comfortable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, rather than for thee.
MAT|11|25||At that time Jesus answered and said: I praise thee, O my Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to little children.
MAT|11|26||Yes, my Father; for so it seemed good before thee.
MAT|11|27||Every thing is given up by my Father to me. And no one knoweth the Son, except the Father. Also, no one knoweth the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal [him].
MAT|11|28||Come unto me, all ye wearied and heavily burdened, and I will ease you.
MAT|11|29||Take my yoke upon you; and learn from me, that I am gentle and subdued in my heart: and ye will find rest for your souls:
MAT|11|30||for my yoke is pleasant, and my burden is light.
MAT|12|1||At that time Jesus, on the sabbath, walked in the tillage grounds: and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears and to eat.
MAT|12|2||And when the Pharisees saw them, they said to him: See; thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
MAT|12|3||But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?
MAT|12|4||How he went to the house of God, and ate the bread of the Lord's table; which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were with him, but solely for the priests?
MAT|12|5||Or have ye not read in the law, how that in the temple the priests profane the sabbath, and are without fault?
MAT|12|6||But I say to you, that a greater than the temple is here.
MAT|12|7||And if ye had known what that is, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; ye would not have criminated them who are without fault.
MAT|12|8||For the Son of man, is lord of the sabbath.
MAT|12|9||And Jesus went from there, and came to their synagogue.
MAT|12|10||And a man was there, whose hand was withered. And they questioned him and said, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might defame him.
MAT|12|11||And he said to them, What man among you is there, who, if he have a sheep, and it fall into a pit on the day of the sabbath, doth not lay hold of it and lift it out?
MAT|12|12||Now, how much better is a human being than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do what is good, on the sabbath.
MAT|12|13||Then said he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched out his hand; and it was restored, and like the other.
MAT|12|14||And the Pharisees went out and held a consultation against him, that they might destroy him.
MAT|12|15||But Jesus knew [it]; and he retired from there. And great multitudes followed him: and he cured them all.
MAT|12|16||And he charged them not to make him known:
MAT|12|17||that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
MAT|12|18||Behold my servant, in whom I have complacency; my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth. I will put my spirit upon him; and he shall proclaim judgment to the Gentiles.
MAT|12|19||He shall not contend, nor be clamorous, nor shall any one hear his voice in the market-place.
MAT|12|20||The crushed reed he will not break; and the flickering lamp he will not extinguish; until he bring judgment to be victorious.
MAT|12|21||And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
MAT|12|22||Then they brought to him a demoniac that was dumb and blind; and he healed him, so that the dumb and blind man both talked and saw.
MAT|12|23||And all the multitude were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?
MAT|12|24||But when the Pharisees heard [it], they said: This man doth not cast out demons, except by Beelzebub the prince of demons.
MAT|12|25||And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: Every kingdom that is divided against itself, will become desolate; and every house or city which is divided against itself, will not stand.
MAT|12|26||Now if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then doth his kingdom stand?
MAT|12|27||And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Wherefore they will be your judges.
MAT|12|28||But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, the kingdom of God hath come near to you.
MAT|12|29||Or how can one enter the house of a strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he may plunder his house.
MAT|12|30||He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me actually scattereth.
MAT|12|31||Therefore I say to you, that all sins and contumelies shall be forgiven to men; but the contumely which is against the Spirit, shall not be forgiven to men.
MAT|12|32||And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him: but whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him;---not in this world, and not in the world to come.
MAT|12|33||Either make the tree good, and its fruits good; or make the tree bad, and its fruits bad: for a tree is known by its fruits.
MAT|12|34||Offspring of vipers, how can ye who are evil, speak good things? For out of the fullnesses of the heart the mouth speaketh.
MAT|12|35||A good man out of good treasures bringeth forth good things, and a bad man out of bad treasures bringeth forth bad things.
MAT|12|36||For I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account of it in the day of judgment.
MAT|12|37||For by thy words thou shalt be justified; and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
MAT|12|38||Then answered some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees, and said to him: Teacher, we wish to see from thee a sign.
MAT|12|39||But he replied and said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation demandeth a sign: but a sign will not be given to it, unless it be the sign of Jonah the prophet.
MAT|12|40||For as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights; so will the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
MAT|12|41||The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment against this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and lo, a greater than Jonah is here.
MAT|12|42||The queen of the south will stand up in the judgment against this generation, and will condemn it: for she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, a superior to Solomon is here.
MAT|12|43||And when an unclean spirit goeth out of a man, it wandereth in places where is no water, and seeketh comfort and findeth [it] not.
MAT|12|44||Then it saith: I will return to my house, from which I came out. And it cometh, and findeth it vacated, and swept clean, and set in order.
MAT|12|45||So it goeth and taketh with it seven other spirits, worse than itself, and they enter and dwell in it; and the end of that man is worse than his beginning. So will it be to this evil generation.
MAT|12|46||And while he was discoursing to the multitudes, his mother and his brothers came and stood without, and sought to speak with him.
MAT|12|47||And a person said to him: Lo, thy mother and thy brothers stand without, and seek to speak with thee.
MAT|12|48||But he replied, and said to him that informed him: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?
MAT|12|49||And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said: Behold my mother, and behold my brothers!
MAT|12|50||For every one that doeth the good pleasure of my Father who is in heaven, that person is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.
MAT|13|1||And on that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the side of the sea.
MAT|13|2||And great multitudes assembled around him; so that he embarked and seated himself in a ship, and all the multitude stood on the shore of the sea.
MAT|13|3||An he discoursed with them much, by similitudes. And he said, Behold, a sower went forth to sow.
MAT|13|4||And as he sowed, some [seed] fell upon the side of a path: and a bird came and devoured it.
MAT|13|5||And other [seed] fell upon a rock, so that it had not much soil: and it sprung up forthwith, because there was no depth of earth.
MAT|13|6||But when the sun was up it wilted. And, because it lacked root, it dried up.
MAT|13|7||And other [seed] fell among thorns: and the thorns shot up, and choked it.
MAT|13|8||And other [seed] fell on good ground; and bore fruits, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
MAT|13|9||He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT|13|10||And his disciples came and said to him, Why discoursest thou to them in similitudes?
MAT|13|11||And he answered, and said to them: Because, to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
MAT|13|12||For to him that hath, shall be given; and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken from him.
MAT|13|13||For this cause I discourse to them in similitudes, because they see and do not see, and they hear and do not hear, nor understand.
MAT|13|14||And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who said: By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and by seeing ye see, and shall not know:
MAT|13|15||For the heart of this people hath grown fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and should hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should turn; and I should heal them.
MAT|13|16||But happy are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
MAT|13|17||For verily I say to you, That many prophets and righteous [men] longed to see what ye see, and did not see [it]; and to hear what ye hear, and did not hear [it].
MAT|13|18||But hear ye the similitude of the seed.
MAT|13|19||Every one that heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the evil one cometh and snatcheth away the seed sowed in his heart: this is what was sowed by the side of the path.
MAT|13|20||And that which was sowed on the rock, is he that heareth the word, and at once receiveth it with joy.
MAT|13|21||Yet hath he no root in him, but is of short duration; and when there is trouble or persecution on account of the word, he soon stumbleth.
MAT|13|22||And that which was sowed among thorns, is he that heareth the word; and care for this world and the deceptiveness of riches, choke the word; and he is without fruits.
MAT|13|23||But that which was sowed on good ground, is he that heareth my word, and understandeth. and beareth fruits, and yieldeth, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
MAT|13|24||Another similitude he proposed to them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
MAT|13|25||And while people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
MAT|13|26||And when the plant shot up and bore fruits, then appeared also the tares.
MAT|13|27||And the servants of the householder came, and said to him, Our lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From whence are the tares in it.
MAT|13|28||And he said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said to him, Is it thy pleasure that we go and gather them out?
MAT|13|29||And he said to them, [No,] lest, while ye gather out the tares, ye also eradicate the wheat with them.
MAT|13|30||Let them both grow together until the harvest; and at the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, Gather out first the tares, and bind them in bundles to be burned; but the wheat gather ye into my granary.
MAT|13|31||Another similitude proposed he to them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like to a kernel of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
MAT|13|32||And this is the least of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than all the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that a bird of heaven may come and nestle in its branches.
MAT|13|33||Another similitude spake he to them, The kingdom of heaven is like the leaven, which a woman took and buried in three measures of meal, until the whole fermented.
MAT|13|34||All these things Jesus discoursed to the multitude in similitudes; and without similitudes he did not discourse with them.
MAT|13|35||That so might be fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, who said: I will open my mouth in similitudes; I will utter things concealed from before the foundation of the world.
MAT|13|36||Then Jesus sent away the multitudes, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, and said: Explain to us the similitude of the tares and the field.
MAT|13|37||And he answered, and said to them: He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of God.
MAT|13|38||And the field is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked One.
MAT|13|39||The enemy that sowed them, is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world: and the reapers are the angels.
MAT|13|40||As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so will it be in the end of the world.
MAT|13|41||The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling blocks, and all the doers of evil;
MAT|13|42||and will cast them into a furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|13|43||Then will the righteous shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT|13|44||Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that is hid in a field; which when a man findeth, he concealeth it, and, from his joy, he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
MAT|13|45||Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman, who sought after rich pearls:
MAT|13|46||and when he found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
MAT|13|47||Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep net, which was cast into the sea, and collected [fishes] of every kind.
MAT|13|48||And when it was full, they drew it to the shores of the sea; and they sat down and culled over: and the good they put into vessels, and the bad they cast away.
MAT|13|49||So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will go forth, and will sever the wicked from among the just;
MAT|13|50||and will cast them into a furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|13|51||Jesus said to them: Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes, our Lord.
MAT|13|52||He said to them: Therefore every Scribe who is instructed for the kingdom of heaven, is like a man who is master of a house, who bringeth forth from his treasures things new and old.
MAT|13|53||And it was so, that when Jesus had ended these similitudes, he departed thence.
MAT|13|54||And he entered into his own city. And he taught them in their synagogues, in such manner that they wondered, and said: Whence hath he this wisdom and [these] works of power?
MAT|13|55||Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
MAT|13|56||And all his sisters, are they not with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
MAT|13|57||And they were stumbled at him. But Jesus said to them: There is no prophet who is little, except in his own city and in his own house.
MAT|13|58||And he did not perform there many works of power, because of their unbelief.
MAT|14|1||And at that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus:
MAT|14|2||and he said to his servants: This is John the Baptizer: he is risen from the grave: therefore works of power are wrought by him.
MAT|14|3||Now this Herod had seized John, and bound him and cast him into prison; on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
MAT|14|4||For John had said to him: It is not lawful for her to be thy wife.
MAT|14|5||And he had wished to kill him; but he was afraid of the people, seeing that they regarded him as a prophet.
MAT|14|6||But when Herod's birthday festival occurred, the daughter of Herodias danced before the guests; and she pleased Herod.
MAT|14|7||Therefore he swore to her by an oath, that he would give her whatsoever she might ask.
MAT|14|8||And she, as she had been instructed by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptizer.
MAT|14|9||And it troubled the king: nevertheless, on account of the oath, and the guests, he commanded that it should be given her.
MAT|14|10||And he sent and cut off the head of John in the prison.
MAT|14|11||And the head was brought in a dish and given to the girl; and she brought it to her mother.
MAT|14|12||And his disciples came and bore away the corpse, and buried [it]; and they went and informed Jesus.
MAT|14|13||And Jesus, when he had heard [it], retired alone, in a ship, to a desert place. And when the multitudes heard [of it], they followed him by dry land from the cities.
MAT|14|14||And when Jesus disembarked, he saw great multitudes; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
MAT|14|15||And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, and said to him: This is a desert place, and the time is gone; send away the throngs of people, that they may go to the villages, and buy themselves food.
MAT|14|16||But he said to them: It is not necessary for them to go; give ye them to eat.
MAT|14|17||And they said to him: We have nothing here but five cakes and two fishes.
MAT|14|18||Jesus said to them: Bring them here to me.
MAT|14|19||And he commanded the multitudes to recline on the ground: and he took the five cakes and two fishes, and he looked towards heaven, and blessed, and brake, and gave to his disciples; and the disciples placed before the multitudes.
MAT|14|20||And they all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the broken remains, twelve full baskets.
MAT|14|21||And the men who had eaten were five thousand, besides the women and children.
MAT|14|22||And immediately he constrained his disciples to embark in a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent away the multitudes.
MAT|14|23||And when he had sent the multitudes away, he ascended a mountain alone to pray. And when it was dark, he was there alone.
MAT|14|24||And the ship was distant from land many furlongs: meanwhile it was much tossed by the waves; for the wind was adverse to it.
MAT|14|25||And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came up to them, walking upon the waters.
MAT|14|26||And his disciples saw him as he walked upon the waters, and they were perturbated: and they said, What we see is a spectre: and they cried out through fear.
MAT|14|27||But Jesus immediately spoke to them, and said: Have courage: it is I; be not afraid.
MAT|14|28||Cephas replied, and said to him: My Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the waters.
MAT|14|29||And Jesus said to him, Come. And Cephas descended from the ship, and walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.
MAT|14|30||But when he saw the wind to be violent, he was afraid, and began to sink. And he raised his voice, and said: My Lord, rescue me.
MAT|14|31||And immediately our Lord reached forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him: O small in faith, why didst thou distrust!
MAT|14|32||And as they entered the ship, the wind subsided.
MAT|14|33||And they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, and said: Truly thou art the Son of God!
MAT|14|34||And they rowed on, and came to the land of Gennesaret.
MAT|14|35||And the men of that place knew him: and they sent to all the villages around them; and they brought to him all that were very sick;
MAT|14|36||and they entreated of him, that they might touch at least the extremity of his garment. And they who touched, were healed.
MAT|15|1||Then came to Jesus Pharisees and Scribes that were from Jerusalem, and said:
MAT|15|2||Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders, and wash not their hands when they eat bread?
MAT|15|3||Jesus replied and said to them: Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, on account of your tradition?
MAT|15|4||For God hath said: Honor thy father, and thy mother; and he that revileth his father or his mother, shall be put to death.
MAT|15|5||But ye say: Whosoever shall say to a father or to a mother, Be that my offering, by which ye get profit from me: then he must not honor his father or his mother.
MAT|15|6||And [thus] ye make void the word of God, for the sake of your tradition.
MAT|15|7||Ye hypocrites, well did the prophet Isaiah prophesy of you, and say:
MAT|15|8||This people honoreth me with the lips, but their heart is far from me.
MAT|15|9||And in vain they pay me homage, while they teach doctrines that are the precepts of men.
MAT|15|10||And he called the multitudes, and said to them, Hear and understand.
MAT|15|11||Not that which entereth the mouth, defileth a man; but that which proceedeth from the mouth, that defileth a man.
MAT|15|12||Then came his disciples, and said to him: Knowest thou, that the Pharisees were offended when they heard that speech?
MAT|15|13||And he replied, and said to them: Every plant, which my Father who is in heaven hath not planted, shall be eradicated.
MAT|15|14||Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leadeth one blind, they will both fall into the ditch.
MAT|15|15||And Simon Cephas answered and said to him: My Lord, explain to us this similitude.
MAT|15|16||And he said to them: Are ye also, up to this time, without understanding?
MAT|15|17||Know ye not, that whatever entereth the mouth, passeth into the belly, and from there is ejected by purgation?
MAT|15|18||But that which proceedeth from the mouth, cometh from the heart: and that is what defileth a man.
MAT|15|19||For, from the heart proceed evil thoughts, adultery, murder, whoredom, theft, false testimony, reviling.
MAT|15|20||These are the things that defile a man. But if a man eat while his hands are unwashed, he is not defiled.
MAT|15|21||And Jesus departed from there, and went to the confines of Tyre and Sidon.
MAT|15|22||And lo, a woman, a Canaanitess from those confines, came forth, calling out and saying: Compassionate me, my Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously distressed by a demon.
MAT|15|23||But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and requested of him, and said: Send her away, for she crieth after us.
MAT|15|24||But he answered and said to them: I am not sent, except to the sheep that have strayed from the house of Israel.
MAT|15|25||And she came, and worshipped him, and said: Help me, my Lord.
MAT|15|26||Jesus said to her: It is not proper, to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs.
MAT|15|27||And she said: Even so, my Lord; yet the dogs eat of the fragments that fall from the tables of their masters, and live.
MAT|15|28||Then Jesus said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that hour.
MAT|15|29||And Jesus departed from there, and came to the side of the sea of Galilee: and he ascended a mountain, and sat there.
MAT|15|30||And great multitudes came to him; and with them were the lame, and the blind, and the dumb, and the maimed, and many others: and they laid them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them.
MAT|15|31||So that the multitudes were amazed, when they saw the dumb speaking, and the maimed made whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they praised the God of Israel.
MAT|15|32||Then Jesus called his disciples, and said to them: I pity this multitude; for lo, these three days they have continued with me, and they have nothing to eat: and I am unwilling to send them away fasting, lest they faint by the way.
MAT|15|33||His disciples say to him: Whence can we get bread in the wilderness, to satisfy all this multitude?
MAT|15|34||Jesus said to them, How many loaves have ye? They said to him, Seven, and a few little fishes.
MAT|15|35||And he commanded the multitudes to recline on the ground.
MAT|15|36||And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
MAT|15|37||And they all ate, and were satisfied. And they took up the remains of fragments, seven full baskets.
MAT|15|38||And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT|15|39||And when he had sent away the multitudes, he took ship, and came to the coasts of Magdala.
MAT|16|1||And Pharisees and Sadducees came near, tempting him, and asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
MAT|16|2||But he answered, and said to them: When it is evening ye say, It will be fair weather; for the heavens are red.
MAT|16|3||And in the morning ye say, There will be a storm to-day; for the heavens are sadly red. Ye hypocrites, ye are intelligent to discover the aspect of the heavens, but the signs of this time ye have no skill to discern.
MAT|16|4||A wicked and adulterous generation asketh for a sign; but no sign shall be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
MAT|16|5||And when his disciples had come to the farther shore, they had forgotten to take bread with them.
MAT|16|6||And he said to them: Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
MAT|16|7||And they reasoned among themselves, and said, [it was] because they had taken no bread.
MAT|16|8||But Jesus knew [it] and said to them: O ye small in faith! why reason ye among yourselves because ye have taken no bread?
MAT|16|9||Have ye not yet understood? Do ye not remember the five loaves and the five thousand, and the many baskets ye took up?
MAT|16|10||Nor the seven loaves and the four thousand, and the many baskets ye took up?
MAT|16|11||How is it that ye do not understand that it was not concerning bread that I spoke to you; but that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
MAT|16|12||Then understood they, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
MAT|16|13||And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he questioned his disciples, and said: What do men say concerning me, that I the Son of man, am?
MAT|16|14||And they said: Some say that [thou art] John the Baptizer; but others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
MAT|16|15||He said to them: But, who do ye yourselves say that I am?
MAT|16|16||Simon Cephas answered and said: Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
MAT|16|17||Jesus answered, and said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonas; for flesh and blood have not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|16|18||Also I say to thee, that thou art Cephas: and upon this rock, I will build my church: and the gates of death shall not triumph over it.
MAT|16|19||To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatever thou shalt unbind on earth, shall be unbound in heaven.
MAT|16|20||Then he enjoined on his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was the Messiah.
MAT|16|21||And from that time Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he was to go up to Jerusalem, and to suffer much from the Elders, and from the chief priests and Scribes, and be killed, and on the third day arise.
MAT|16|22||And Cephas took him, and began to rebuke him; and he said: Far be it from thee, my Lord, that this should be to thee.
MAT|16|23||But he turned, and said to Cephas: Get thee behind me, Satan: Thou art a stumbling block to me; for thou thinkest not the things of God, but the things of men.
MAT|16|24||Then said Jesus to his disciples: If any one desireth to come after me, let him deny himself; and let him bear his cross, and come after me.
MAT|16|25||For, whoever chooseth to preserve his life, shall lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
MAT|16|26||For what will it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and shall lose his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
MAT|16|27||For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father, with all his holy angels; and then will he recompense to every man as his deeds are.
MAT|16|28||Verily I say to you: There are some persons standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
MAT|17|1||And after six days Jesus took Cephas, and James, and John his brother, and conducted them alone to a high mountain.
MAT|17|2||And Jesus was changed before them: and his face shone like the sun; and his vestments became white like the light.
MAT|17|3||And there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, in conversation with him.
MAT|17|4||Then Cephas answered and said to Jesus: My Lord, it is good for us to be here: and, if it please thee, we will make here three booths; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
MAT|17|5||And while he was yet speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and there was a voice from the cloud which said: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have pleasure; hear ye him.
MAT|17|6||And when the disciples heard [it], they fell on their faces, and were much afraid.
MAT|17|7||And Jesus came to them and touched them, and said: Arise, and be not afraid.
MAT|17|8||And they raised their eyes, and they saw no person, except Jesus only.
MAT|17|9||And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, and said to them: Speak of this vision before no person, until the Son of man shall have arisen from the dead.
MAT|17|10||And his disciples asked him, and said to him: Why then do the Scribes say, that Elijah must first come?
MAT|17|11||Jesus answered, and said to them: Elijah doth first come, to fulfill every thing.
MAT|17|12||And I say to you. That, behold, Elijah hath come, and they did not know him; and they have done to him whatever they pleased: and, in like manner, also the Son of man is to suffer from them.
MAT|17|13||Then the disciples understood, that he spake to them of John the Baptizer.
MAT|17|14||And when they came to the multitude, a man approached him, and bowed himself on his knees,
MAT|17|15||and said to him: My Lord, compassionate me. I have a son who is a lunatic, and grievously afflicted; for often he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
MAT|17|16||And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.
MAT|17|17||Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? and how long bear with you? Bring him here to me.
MAT|17|18||And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it departed from him: and from that hour the child was healed.
MAT|17|19||Then came the disciples to Jesus, apart, and said to him: Why could not we heal him?
MAT|17|20||Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, That if there be in you faith like a grain of mustard seed, ye may say to this mountain, Remove hence, and it will remove: and nothing will be too hard for you.
MAT|17|21||But this kind goeth not out, except by fasting and prayer.
MAT|17|22||And while they were resident in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man is to be betrayed into the hands of men;
MAT|17|23||and they will kill him; and the third day he will arise. And it saddened them much.
MAT|17|24||And when they came to Capernaum, those who receive the two drachmas of capitation money came to Cephas, and said to him: Doth not your rabbi pay his two drachmas?
MAT|17|25||He said to them, Yes. And when Cephas had entered the house, Jesus anticipated him and said to him: How doth it appear to thee, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute and capitation money? of their children, or of aliens?
MAT|17|26||Simon said to him: Of aliens. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.
MAT|17|27||But still, lest they be stumbled with us, go thou to the sea and cast in a fish-hook, and the fish that shall first come up, open its mouth, and thou wilt find a stater: that take, and give for me and for thyself.
MAT|18|1||In that hour the disciples approached Jesus, and said: Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
MAT|18|2||And Jesus called a child, and placed him in the midst of them,
MAT|18|3||and said: Verily I say to you, that unless ye be converted, and become like children, ye will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|18|4||He therefore that shall humble himself like this child, he will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|18|5||And he that shall receive in my name [one who is] like to this child, he receiveth me.
MAT|18|6||And whosoever shall stumble one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were suspended to his neck, and that he were sunk in the depths of the sea.
MAT|18|7||Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it must be, that stumbling blocks come. But, woe to the person by whose means the stumbling blocks come.
MAT|18|8||If then thy hand or thy foot make thee stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is good for thee to enter into life lame or mutilated, and not that, with two hands or two feet, thou fall into eternal fire.
MAT|18|9||And if thine eye make thee stumble, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, and not that, with two eyes, thou fall into the hell of fire.
MAT|18|10||See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That their angels in heaven, at all times, are beholding the face of my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|18|11||For the Son of man, hath come to give life to that which was lost.
MAT|18|12||How doth it appear to you? If a man should have a hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray, will he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains, and go and seek the one that strayed?
MAT|18|13||And if he find it, verily I say to you, that he rejoiceth in it, more than in the ninety and nine that did not stray.
MAT|18|14||Just so, it is not the pleasure of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
MAT|18|15||Moreover, if thy brother commit an offence against thee, go and admonish him between thee and him only. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
MAT|18|16||But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
MAT|18|17||And if he will also not hear them, tell [it] to the church. And if he will also not hear the church, let him be to thee as a publican and a heathen.
MAT|18|18||Verily I say to you, That whatever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall unbind on earth, shall be unbound in heaven.
MAT|18|19||Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be to them from my Father who is in heaven.
MAT|18|20||For where two or three [are] assembled in my name, there [am] I in the midst of them.
MAT|18|21||Then Cephas approached him, and said to him: My Lord, how many times, if my brother commit offence against me, shall I forgive him? up to seven times?
MAT|18|22||Jesus said to him: I do not say to thee, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
MAT|18|23||Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like to some king, who wished to have a reckoning with his servants.
MAT|18|24||And when he began to reckon, they brought to him one debtor of ten thousand talents.
MAT|18|25||And as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, him and his wife and his children, and all that he possessed, and payment to be made.
MAT|18|26||And that servant fell down and worshipped him, and said: My lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee the whole.
MAT|18|27||And his lord had compassion on that servant, and set him free, and forgave him his debt.
MAT|18|28||Then that servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hold of him and choked him, and said to him: Pay me what thou owest me.
MAT|18|29||And that fellow-servant fell at his feet and entreated him, and said: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee the whole.
MAT|18|30||But he would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay him what he owed him.
MAT|18|31||And when their fellow-servants saw what was done, it grieved them much; and they came and made known to their lord all that had occurred.
MAT|18|32||Then his lord called him, and said to him: Thou vile servant! Lo, I forgave thee that whole debt, because thou entreatedst of me:
MAT|18|33||oughtest not thou also to have compassion on thy fellow-servant, as I had compassion on thee?
MAT|18|34||And his lord was angry, and delivered him over to the torturers, until he should pay all he owed him.
MAT|18|35||So will my Father who is in heaven do to you, unless ye from your heart forgive each his brother his offence.
MAT|19|1||And when Jesus had ended these discourses, he removed from Galilee, and came to the confines of Judaea on the other side of Jordan.
MAT|19|2||And great multitudes followed after him, and he healed them there.
MAT|19|3||And Pharisees came to him, and tempted him and said: Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?
MAT|19|4||And he answered and said to them: Have ye not read, that he who made [them] at the beginning, made them a male and a female?
MAT|19|5||And he said: For this reason, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and adhere to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.
MAT|19|6||Wherefore they were not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath united, let not man sunder.
MAT|19|7||They say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put her away?
MAT|19|8||He said to them: Moses, on account of the hardness of your heart, permitted you to divorce your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
MAT|19|9||And I say to you, That whoever leaveth his wife not being an adulteress, and taketh another, committeth adultery. And whoever taketh her that is divorced, committeth adultery.
MAT|19|10||His disciples say to him: If such is the case between man and wife, it is not expedient to take a wife.
MAT|19|11||But he said to them: Not every one is capable of that thing, but he only to whom it is given.
MAT|19|12||For there are some eunuchs, born so from their mother's womb; and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are some eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that can be contented let him be contented.
MAT|19|13||Then they brought children to him, that he might lay his hand upon them and pray. And his disciples rebuked them.
MAT|19|14||But Jesus said to them: Allow children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of those that are like them is the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|19|15||And he laid his hand upon them, and departed from there.
MAT|19|16||And one came, drew near, and said to him: Good Teacher, what good thing must I do, that eternal life may be mine?
MAT|19|17||And he said to him: Why callest thou me good? There is none good, except one, [namely,] God. But if thou wouldst enter into life, keep the commandments.
MAT|19|18||He said to him, Which? And Jesus said to him: Thou shalt not kill; and thou shalt not commit adultery; and thou shalt not steal; and thou shalt not bear false testimony;
MAT|19|19||and honor thy father and thy mother; and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
MAT|19|20||The young man saith to him: All these have I kept from my childhood. What do I lack?
MAT|19|21||Jesus saith to him: If thou desirest to be perfect, go, sell thy property, and give to the poor; and there shall be for thee a treasure in heaven; and come thou after me.
MAT|19|22||And the young man heard that speech, and he went away in sadness; for he had much property.
MAT|19|23||And Jesus said to his disciples: Verily I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
MAT|19|24||And again, I say to you: It is easier for a camel to enter the aperture of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God
MAT|19|25||And when the disciples heard [it], they wondered greatly, and said: Who then can attain to life!
MAT|19|26||Jesus looked on them, and said to them: With men this is not practicable, but with God every thing is practicable.
MAT|19|27||Then answered Cephas, and said to him: Lo, we have forsaken every thing, and come after thee: What therefore shall we receive?
MAT|19|28||Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, that, as for you who have followed me, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory in the new world, ye also shall sit on twelve seats, and shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
MAT|19|29||And every man that relinquisheth houses, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
MAT|19|30||But there are many first who shall be last, and last [who shall be] first.
MAT|20|1||For the kingdom of heaven is like a man, the lord of a house, who went out, at dawn of day, to hire laborers for his vineyard.
MAT|20|2||And he contracted with the labors for a denarius a day: and sent them into his vineyard.
MAT|20|3||And he went out at the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place:
MAT|20|4||and he said to them, Go ye also into my vineyard, and what is right I will give you;
MAT|20|5||and they went. And again he went out at the sixth and ninth hours, and did the same.
MAT|20|6||And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others who were standing and idle; and he said to them: Why stand ye all the day, and are idle?
MAT|20|7||They say to him, Because no one hath hired us. He saith to them: Go ye also into the vineyard; and what is right ye shall receive.
MAT|20|8||And when it was evening, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward: Call the laborers, and give them their wages; and commence with the last, and proceed to the first.
MAT|20|9||And those of the eleventh hour came, and received each a denarius.
MAT|20|10||And when the first came, they supposed they should receive more; but they also received each a denarius.
MAT|20|11||And when they received [it], they murmured against the lord of the house,
MAT|20|12||and said: These last have labored but one hour, and thou hast made them equal with us who have borne the burden of the day and the heat of it.
MAT|20|13||But he answered, and said to one of them: My friend, I do thee no injustice: was it not for a denarius that thou didst contract with me?
MAT|20|14||Take what belongeth to thee, and go: for I am disposed to give to this last, as to thee.
MAT|20|15||Is it not lawful for me, to do what I please with what belongeth to me; or is thy eye evil, because I am good?
MAT|20|16||Thus the last shall be first, and the first last: for the called are many, but the chosen are few.
MAT|20|17||And Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem: and he took his twelve disciples aside, on the way, and said to them:
MAT|20|18||Behold we are going to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and to the Scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
MAT|20|19||And they will deliver him over to the Gentiles: and they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will crucify him; and the third day, he will arise.
MAT|20|20||Then came, to him the mother of Zebedee's children, she and her sons; and she worshipped him, and asked something from him.
MAT|20|21||And he said to her, What desirest thou? She said to him: Say, that these my two sons shall sit, the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
MAT|20|22||Jesus answered and said: Ye know not what ye ask for. Can ye drink of the cup, of which I am to drink? or be baptized with the baptism, that I am baptized with? They say to him: We can.
MAT|20|23||He saith to them: Ye will [indeed] drink of my cup, and will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but that ye should sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, except to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.
MAT|20|24||And when the ten heard [it], they were angry against the two brothers.
MAT|20|25||And Jesus called them, and said to them: Ye know that the princes of the nations are their lords, and their great men exercise authority over them.
MAT|20|26||Not so shall it be among you. But whoever among you desireth to be great, let him be to you, a ministerer:
MAT|20|27||and whoever among you desireth to be first, let him be your servant:
MAT|20|28||even as the Son of man came, not to be served, but to serve; and to give his life a ransom for many.
MAT|20|29||And as Jesus passed out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
MAT|20|30||And lo, two blind men were sitting by the way side. And when they heard that Jesus was passing, they called out, and said: Have compassion on us, my Lord, thou son of David!
MAT|20|31||And the multitudes rebuked them, that they might be silent. But they raised their voice the more, and said: Our Lord, have compassion on us, thou son of David.
MAT|20|32||And Jesus stopped, and called them, and said: What wish ye, that I should do for you?
MAT|20|33||They said to him: Our Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
MAT|20|34||And he had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes were opened, and they followed him.
MAT|21|1||And as he approached Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, by the side of the mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples;
MAT|21|2||and said to them: Go into this village which is over against you, and directly ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with her. Untie and bring [them] to me.
MAT|21|3||And if any man say ought to you, tell him, That they are needed by our Lord: and at once he will send them hither.
MAT|21|4||Now this whole occurrence was, that so might be fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
MAT|21|5||Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king cometh to thee, meek, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.
MAT|21|6||And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them.
MAT|21|7||And they brought the ass and the colt. And they placed their garments on the colt, and set Jesus upon it.
MAT|21|8||And a very great throng strewed their clothes in the path; and others cut branches from the trees, and cast them in the path.
MAT|21|9||And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed after him, shouted and said: Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
MAT|21|10||And as he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in commotion; and they said, Who is this?
MAT|21|11||And the multitudes said, This is Jesus the prophet, who is from Nazareth of Galilee.
MAT|21|12||And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and expelled all them that bought and sold in the temple, and overset the counters of the money-brokers, and the seats of them that sold doves.
MAT|21|13||And he said to them: It is written, my house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of robbers.
MAT|21|14||And there came to him in the temple the blind and the lame; and he healed them.
MAT|21|15||And when the chief priests and Pharisees saw the wonderful things which he performed, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, their indignation was excited.
MAT|21|16||And they said to him: Hearest thou what these are saying? Jesus said to them: Yes. Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of children and infants thou hast acquired praise?
MAT|21|17||And he left them, and retired out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
MAT|21|18||And in the morning, when he returned to the city, he was hungry.
MAT|21|19||And he saw a fig-tree by the way, and came to it and found nothing on it, except leaves only. And he said to it: There shall no more be fruit on thee for ever. And immediately the fig-tree withered.
MAT|21|20||And the disciples saw [it], and admired, and said: How suddenly hath the fig-tree withered!
MAT|21|21||Jesus replied and said to them: Verily I say to you, That if there be faith in you, and ye shall not doubt, ye may not only do this thing of the fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, be thou lifted up, and fall into the sea, it will be so.
MAT|21|22||And whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, and shall believe, ye shall receive.
MAT|21|23||And when Jesus came to the temple, the chief priests and the Elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said to him: By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?
MAT|21|24||Jesus replied and said to them: I also will ask you one question, and if ye will tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT|21|25||The baptism of John, from whence was it? From heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, and said: If we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why did ye not believe in him?
MAT|21|26||And if we should say, From men; we are afraid of the multitude, for they all hold John as a prophet.
MAT|21|27||And they answered, and said to him: We do not know. Jesus said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT|21|28||But how appeareth it to you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first and said to him, My son, go, labor to-day in the vineyard.
MAT|21|29||And he answered and said, I am not willing. But afterwards he repented and went.
MAT|21|30||And he came to the other, and said the same to him. And he answered and said: I [go], my lord, but did not go.
MAT|21|31||Which of these two performed the pleasure of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you That publicans and harlots go before you into the kingdom of God.
MAT|21|32||For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him: and ye, after ye had seen [it], did not even then repent and believe in him.
MAT|21|33||Hear ye another similitude. A certain man, the lord of a house, planted a vineyard, and inclosed it with a hedge, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower in it, and leased it to cultivators, and removed to a distance.
MAT|21|34||And when the time for the fruits arrived, he sent his servants to the cultivators that they might remit to him of the fruits of the vineyard.
MAT|21|35||And the cultivators laid hold of his servants, and beat one, and stoned another and one they slew.
MAT|21|36||And again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first; and they did the like to them.
MAT|21|37||And at last he sent to them his son: for he said, Perhaps they will respect my son.
MAT|21|38||But the cultivators, when they saw the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: Come; let us kill him, and retain his inheritance.
MAT|21|39||And they laid hold of him, thrust him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
MAT|21|40||When the lord of the vineyard, therefore, shall come; what will he do to those cultivators?
MAT|21|41||They say to him: He will utterly destroy them; and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
MAT|21|42||Jesus said to them: Have ye never read in the scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, hath become the head of the corner: this is from the Lord; and it is marvellous in our eyes?
MAT|21|43||Therefore I say to you, That the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a people that will yield fruits.
MAT|21|44||And whoever shall fall upon this stone, will be fractured; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to atoms?
MAT|21|45||And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his similitudes, they understood that he spoke in reference to them.
MAT|21|46||And they sought to apprehend him, but were afraid of the multitude, because they accounted him as a prophet.
MAT|22|1||And Jesus answered again by similitudes, and said:
MAT|22|2||The kingdom of heaven is like to a royal person, who made a feast for his son.
MAT|22|3||And he sent his servants to call those that had been invited, to the feast: and they would not come.
MAT|22|4||And again he sent other servants, and said: Tell those invited, Behold, my entertainment is prepared, my oxen and my fatlings are slain, and every thing is prepared; come ye to the feast.
MAT|22|5||But they showed contempt, and went away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise;
MAT|22|6||and the rest seized his servants, and abused them, and slew them.
MAT|22|7||And when the king heard [of it], he was angry; and he sent his military forces, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
MAT|22|8||Then said he to his servants, The feast is prepared, but they who were invited were unworthy.
MAT|22|9||Go ye therefore to the terminations of the streets; and as many as ye find, bid to the feast.
MAT|22|10||And those servants went out into the streets, and collected all they found, both bad and good; and the place of feasting was filled with guests.
MAT|22|11||And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who was not clad in the festal garments.
MAT|22|12||And he said to him: My friend, how camest thou here without the festal robes? But he was silent.
MAT|22|13||Then said the king to the servitors: Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|22|14||For the called are many, and the chosen are few.
MAT|22|15||Then went the Pharisees and took counsel, how they might ensnare him in discourse.
MAT|22|16||And they sent to him their disciples, with domestics of Herod, and said to him: Teacher, we know that thou art veracious, and teachest the way of God with truth, regardless of man, for thou hast no respect of persons.
MAT|22|17||Tell us, therefore, how doth it appear to thee: is it lawful to pay capitation money to Caesar, or not?
MAT|22|18||But Jesus knew their wickedness, and said: Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
MAT|22|19||Show me a denarius of the capitation money. And they brought to him a denarius.
MAT|22|20||And Jesus said to them: Whose is this image and inscription?
MAT|22|21||They say, Caesar's. He saith to them: Give then Caesar's things to Caesar, and God's things to God.
MAT|22|22||And when they heard [it] they were surprised: and they left him, and went away.
MAT|22|23||The same day came Sadducees, and said to him: There is no life of the dead. And they questioned him,
MAT|22|24||and said to him: Teacher; Moses commanded us, that if a man should die childless, his brother must take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
MAT|22|25||Now there were with us seven brothers. The first took a wife, and deceased; and, as he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
MAT|22|26||In like manner also the second, and the third, and up to the whole seven.
MAT|22|27||And after them all, the woman also herself died.
MAT|22|28||In the resurrection, therefore, to which of those seven will she be the wife? For they all had taken her?
MAT|22|29||Jesus answered, and said to them: Ye do err, from not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
MAT|22|30||For in the resurrection of the dead, they do not take wives, nor are wives given to husbands; but they are as the angels of God in heaven.
MAT|22|31||But as to the resurrection of the dead,: have ye not read what was spoken to you by God, who said:
MAT|22|32||I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob? Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
MAT|22|33||And when the multitude heard [it] they were astonished at his doctrine.
MAT|22|34||And when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they assembled together;
MAT|22|35||and one of them, who was expert in the law, to tempt him, inquired:
MAT|22|36||Teacher, which is the great command in the law?
MAT|22|37||Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thy mind.
MAT|22|38||This is the great and first command.
MAT|22|39||And the second, which is like it, is, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
MAT|22|40||On these two commands hang the law and the prophets.
MAT|22|41||And while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus questioned them,
MAT|22|42||and said: What say ye respecting, the Messiah? Whose son is he? They say to him; The son of David.
MAT|22|43||He saith to them: How then doth David, by the Spirit, call him Lord? for he said:
MAT|22|44||The Lord said to my Lord, Seat thyself at my right hand, until I place thy enemies under thy feet.
MAT|22|45||If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
MAT|22|46||And no one was able to give him an answer? And from that day, no one dared to question him.
MAT|23|1||Then Jesus conversed with the multitude and with his disciples,
MAT|23|2||and said to them: The Scribes and Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.
MAT|23|3||Whatever therefore they tell you to observe, that observe and do. But according to their deeds, practise ye not: for they say, and do not.
MAT|23|4||They tie up heavy burdens, and lay [them] on men's shoulders; but will not themselves touch them with their finger.
MAT|23|5||And all their works they do, to be seen of men: for they make their phylacteries broad, and extend the fringes of their garments.
MAT|23|6||And they love the highest couches at suppers and the highest seats in the synagogues,
MAT|23|7||and the greeting in the market places, and to be addressed by men with Rabbi.
MAT|23|8||But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Rabbi, and ye are all brethren.
MAT|23|9||And ye shall not call yourselves Father on earth; for one is your Father, who is in heaven.
MAT|23|10||And be ye not called guides; for one is your Guide, the Messiah.
MAT|23|11||And the great one among you will be your servitor.
MAT|23|12||For whoever shall] exalt himself, will be abased: and whoever shall abase himself, will be exalted.
MAT|23|13||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye devour the houses of widows, under the disguise of protracting your prayers. Therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.
MAT|23|14||Woe to you. Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye hold the kingdom of heaven closed before men; for ye enter not yourselves, and those that would enter ye suffer not to enter.
MAT|23|15||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye traverse sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is gained, ye make him a child of hell twofold more than yourselves.
MAT|23|16||Woe to you, ye blind guides: for ye say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold that is in the temple, he is holden.
MAT|23|17||Ye fools, and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
MAT|23|18||And, whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing: but whoever shall swear by the oblation upon it, he is holden.
MAT|23|19||Ye fools, and blind: for which is greater, the oblation, or the altar that sanctifieth the oblation?
MAT|23|20||He therefore who sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all that is upon it.
MAT|23|21||And he who sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it.
MAT|23|22||And he who sweareth by heaven, sweareth by throne of God, and by him that sitteth on it.
MAT|23|23||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye tithe mint, and anise, and cummin, and omit the graver [matters] of the law, judgment, and mercy, and fidelity: these ought ye to do, and those not to omit.
MAT|23|24||Ye blind guides, who strain out gnats, and swallow down camels.
MAT|23|25||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, while within they are full of rapine and wickedness.
MAT|23|26||Ye blind Pharisees, cleanse first the inside of the cup and dish, that their outside may be clean also.
MAT|23|27||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye are like whited sepulchres, which appear comely without, but are within full of bones of the dead and all impurity.
MAT|23|28||So ye also, outwardly, appear to men as righteous; but within, ye are full of iniquity and hypocrisy.
MAT|23|29||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye build the tombs of the prophets and ye adorn the sepulchres of the righteous;
MAT|23|30||and ye say: If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been participators with them in the blood of the prophets.
MAT|23|31||Wherefore ye are witnesses, against yourselves, that ye are the children of them that killed the prophets.
MAT|23|32||And as for you, fill ye up the measure of your fathers.
MAT|23|33||Ye serpents, ye race of vipers: how can ye escape the condemnation of hell?
MAT|23|34||Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; some of whom ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and will persecute them from city to city:
MAT|23|35||so that on you may come all the blood of the righteous, which hath been shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
MAT|23|36||Verily I say to you, that all these things will come upon this generation.
MAT|23|37||O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee: how often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathereth her young under her wings, and ye would not.
MAT|23|38||Behold, your house is left to you desolate!
MAT|23|39||For I say to you, That ye shall not see me henceforth, until ye shall say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
MAT|24|1||And Jesus passed out of the temple to go away: and his disciples came to him, showing him the structure of the temple.
MAT|24|2||And he said to them: See ye not all these? Verily I say to you, There will not be left here a stone upon a stone, that is not demolished.
MAT|24|3||And as Jesus sat on the mount of Olives, his disciples came, and said between themselves and him: Tell us when these things are to be; and what will be the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the world.
MAT|24|4||Jesus answered and said to them: Take heed, that no one deceive you.
MAT|24|5||For many will come in my name, and will say, I am the Messiah: and they will deceive many.
MAT|24|6||And ye are to hear of conflicts, and the rumor of battles. See that ye be not disquieted: for all these things must come; but the consummation is not yet.
MAT|24|7||For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places.
MAT|24|8||But all these are only the commencement of sorrows.
MAT|24|9||And they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you: and ye will be hated by all nations, on account of my name.
MAT|24|10||Then many will be stumbled: and they will hate one another, and will betray one another.
MAT|24|11||And many false prophets will rise up; and they will deceive many.
MAT|24|12||And on account of the abounding of iniquity, the love of many will decline.
MAT|24|13||But he that shall persevere to the end, will have life.
MAT|24|14||And this announcement of the kingdom shall be published in all the world, for a testimony to all nations: and then will come the consummation.
MAT|24|15||And when ye see the abominable sign of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place; then let the reader consider;
MAT|24|16||and then let them who are in Judaea, flee to the mountain:
MAT|24|17||and let him who is on the roof, not come down to take what is in his house:
MAT|24|18||and let him who is in the field, not return back to take his clothing.
MAT|24|19||But woe to those with child, and to them that are nursing, in those days.
MAT|24|20||And pray ye, that your flight be not in winter, or on the sabbath.
MAT|24|21||For there will then be great distress, such as hath not been from the commencement of the world, until now, and will not be.
MAT|24|22||And unless those days should be cut short, no flesh would remain alive. But, for the elect's sake, those days will be cut short.
MAT|24|23||Then, if any one shall say to you, Lo, the Messiah is here, or is there; give no credence.
MAT|24|24||For there will arise false Messiahs, and mendacious prophets; who will exhibit great signs, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
MAT|24|25||Behold, I have told you beforehand.
MAT|24|26||If therefore they say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not out: or, Behold, he is in a secret chamber; give no credence.
MAT|24|27||As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth unto the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man.
MAT|24|28||And wherever the carcass may be, there will the eagles be congregated.
MAT|24|29||And immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not show her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be agitated.
MAT|24|30||And then will be seen the signal of the Son of man in heaven: and then will all the tribes of the earth mourn, when they see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
MAT|24|31||And he will send his angels with a great trumpet and they will collect together his elect from the four winds, from one extremity of heaven to the other.
MAT|24|32||And learn ye an illustration from the fig-tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves shoot forth, ye know that summer is coming on.
MAT|24|33||So also ye, when ye perceive all these things, know ye, that he is nigh, [even] at the door.
MAT|24|34||Verily I say to you, That this generation shall not pass away, till all these things shall be.
MAT|24|35||Heaven and earth will pass away; but my words shall not pass away.
MAT|24|36||But of that day and of that hour, knoweth no man, nor even the angels of heaven, but the Father only.
MAT|24|37||And as the days of Noah, so will the coming of the Son of man be.
MAT|24|38||For as, before the flood, they were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving to husbands, up to the day that Noah entered the ark,
MAT|24|39||and knew not, until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of man be.
MAT|24|40||Then will two [men] be in the field; the one will be taken, and the other left.
MAT|24|41||Two [women] will be grinding at the mill; the one taken, and the other left.
MAT|24|42||Watch, therefore, since ye know not at what hour your Lord cometh.
MAT|24|43||But know this, that if the lord of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have been awake, and would not have suffered his house to be broken into.
MAT|24|44||Therefore, be ye also ready; for at an hour ye do not expect, the Son of man will come.
MAT|24|45||Who then, is that faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath placed over his domestics, to give them their food in its time?
MAT|24|46||Happy is that servant, whom, when his lord shall come, he will find so doing.
MAT|24|47||Verily I say to you, He will place him over all that he hath.
MAT|24|48||But if that servant, being wicked, shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
MAT|24|49||and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall be eating and drinking with drunkards;
MAT|24|50||the lord of that servant will come in a day he will not expect, and in an hour he knoweth not,
MAT|24|51||and will cut him asunder, and will assign him his portion with the hypocrites; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|25|1||Then may the kingdom of heaven be shadowed forth by ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom and bride.
MAT|25|2||And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
MAT|25|3||And the foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them.
MAT|25|4||But the wise took oil in vessels, with their lamps.
MAT|25|5||And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became sleepy and fell asleep.
MAT|25|6||And at midnight there was an outcry: Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
MAT|25|7||Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
MAT|25|8||And the foolish said to the wise; Give us of your oil; for, behold, our lamps have gone out.
MAT|25|9||The wise answered and said: [We must refuse,] lest there should not be enough for us and for you: but go ye to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
MAT|25|10||And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready, went with him into the house of the nuptials, and the door was shut.
MAT|25|11||And at length came also the other virgins, and said: Our lord, our lord, open to us.
MAT|25|12||But he answered, and said to them: Verily I say to you, I know you not.
MAT|25|13||Watch, therefore, seeing ye know not the day nor the hour.
MAT|25|14||For, as a man that took a journey, called his servants and delivered to them his property;
MAT|25|15||to one he gave five talents; to another, two; and to another, one: to each, according to his ability: and he immediately departed.
MAT|25|16||Then he that received five talents, went and traded with them, and gained five more.
MAT|25|17||And likewise: the one of two [talents], by trading gained two more.
MAT|25|18||But he that received one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
MAT|25|19||And after a long time, the lord of those servants came, and received account from them.
MAT|25|20||And he who had received the five talents, came and brought five others; and said, My lord, thou gavest me five talents; behold, I have gained by trading five more to them.
MAT|25|21||His lord said to him: Well done! good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful with a little; I will set thee over much: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
MAT|25|22||And he of the two talents came, and said: My lord, thou gavest me two talents; behold, I have by trading gained two more to them.
MAT|25|23||His lord said to him: Well done! Good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful with a little; I will set thee over much: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
MAT|25|24||And he also that received the one talent, came and said: My lord, I knew thee, that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sowed, and gathering where thou hast not scattered;
MAT|25|25||and I was afraid, and I went and hid thy talent in the earth. Behold, thou hast what is thine.
MAT|25|26||His lord answered, and said to him: Wicked and slothful servant! Thou knewest me, that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not scattered!
MAT|25|27||Thou oughtest to have cast my money into the exchange; and I might have come and demanded my property with its interest.
MAT|25|28||Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.
MAT|25|29||For, to him that hath, shall be given, and he shall have more; but from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away.
MAT|25|30||And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT|25|31||And when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels with him, then will he sit upon the throne of his glory.
MAT|25|32||And before him will be gathered all nations; and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd severeth the sheep from the goats.
MAT|25|33||And he will place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
MAT|25|34||Then will the king say to those on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father; inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
MAT|25|35||For I was hungry, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me home;
MAT|25|36||I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.
MAT|25|37||Then will the righteous say to him: Our Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
MAT|25|38||And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee home? or naked, and clothed thee?
MAT|25|39||And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?
MAT|25|40||And the king will answer, and say to them: Verily I say to you, That inasmuch as ye did so to one of these my little brothers, ye did so to me.
MAT|25|41||Then will he say also to them on his left hand: Go from me, ye accursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the Calumniator and his angels,
MAT|25|42||For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food; and I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
MAT|25|43||and I was a stranger, and ye took me not home; and I was naked, and ye clothed me not; and I was sick and in prison, and ye did not visit me.
MAT|25|44||Then will they also answer and say: Our Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
MAT|25|45||Then will he answer, and say to them: Verily I say to you, That in as much as ye did not so to one of these little ones, ye did not so to me.
MAT|25|46||And these will go into everlasting torment, and the righteous into everlasting life.
MAT|26|1||And it came to pass, when Jesus had concluded all these discourses, that he said to his disciples:
MAT|26|2||Ye know that after two days is the Passover; and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
MAT|26|3||Then assembled the chief priests and the Scribes and the Elders of the people, at the hall of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
MAT|26|4||And they held a counsel against Jesus, that they might take him by guile, and kill him.
MAT|26|5||But they said: Not on the festival, lest there be a commotion among the people.
MAT|26|6||And when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
MAT|26|7||there came to him a woman having a vase of aromatic ointment very precious, and she poured it on the head of Jesus as he was reclining.
MAT|26|8||And when his disciples saw [it] they were displeased, and said: Why is this waste?
MAT|26|9||For this [ointment] might have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.
MAT|26|10||But Jesus knew [their dissatisfaction], and said to them: Why trouble ye the woman? She hath performed a good deed towards me.
MAT|26|11||For the poor ye have at all times with you; but I am not with you always
MAT|26|12||And this her act, pouring the ointment on my body, she hath done as it were for my burial.
MAT|26|13||Verily I say to you, That wherever this my gospel shall be proclaimed, in all the world, this thing that she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.
MAT|26|14||Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
MAT|26|15||and said to them: What will ye give me, if I will deliver him to you? And they promised him thirty pieces of silver.
MAT|26|16||And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
MAT|26|17||And on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, and said to him: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
MAT|26|18||And he said to them: Go ye into the city, to such a man, and say to him: Our Rabbi saith, My time approaches: with thee will I keep the passover with my disciples
MAT|26|19||And his disciples did as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.
MAT|26|20||And when it was evening, he reclined with his twelve disciples.
MAT|26|21||And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, That one of you will betray me.
MAT|26|22||And it troubled them much. And they began each one of them to say to him; My Lord is it I?
MAT|26|23||And he answered and said: One that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
MAT|26|24||And the Son of man goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man, if he had not been born.
MAT|26|25||Judas the betrayer answered and said: Rabbi, is it I? Jesus said to him: Thou hast said.
MAT|26|26||And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake; and gave to his disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
MAT|26|27||And he took the cup, and offered thanks and gave [it] to them, saying: Take, drink of this all of you.
MAT|26|28||This is my blood of the new testament, which, in behalf of many, is shed for the remission of sins.
MAT|26|29||But I say to you, that I will henceforth not drink of this product of the vine, until the day in which I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of God.
MAT|26|30||And they sang praises, and went forth to the mount of Olives.
MAT|26|31||Then said Jesus to them: Ye will all be offended in me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of his flock will be dispersed.
MAT|26|32||But after I am arisen, I will go before you into Galilee.
MAT|26|33||Cephas replied, and said to him: Though all men should be offended in thee, I will never be offended in thee.
MAT|26|34||Jesus said to him: Verily I say to thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt thrice deny me.
MAT|26|35||Cephas said to him: If I were to die with thee, I would not deny thee: and so also said all the disciples.
MAT|26|36||Then came Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray.
MAT|26|37||And he took Cephas and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be dejected and sorrowful.
MAT|26|38||And he said to them: There is anguish in my soul, even unto death. Wait for me here; and watch with me.
MAT|26|39||And retiring a little, he fell on his face, and prayed, and said: My Father, if it can be so, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I choose, but as thou.
MAT|26|40||And he came to his disciples, and found them asleep: and he said to Cephas: So! could ye not watch with me one hour?
MAT|26|41||Wake ye, and pray, lest ye fall into temptation. The mind is prepared, but the body is infirm.
MAT|26|42||Again he went away the second time, and prayed, and said: My Father, if it cannot be that this cup pass, except I drink it, thy will be done.
MAT|26|43||And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
MAT|26|44||And he left them, and went again and prayed the third time, and used the same language.
MAT|26|45||Then he came to his disciples, and said to them: Sleep on now, and take rest. Behold, the hour is come: and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
MAT|26|46||Arise, let us go. Behold, he that betrayeth me hath come.
MAT|26|47||And while he was yet speaking, lo, Judas the betrayer, one of the twelve, arrived; and a great multitude with him, with swords and clubs, from the presence of the chief priests and elders of the people.
MAT|26|48||And Judas the betrayer had given them a sign, saying: He it is, whom I shall kiss: him seize ye.
MAT|26|49||And forthwith he approached Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
MAT|26|50||And Jesus said to him: My friend, is it for this thou hast come? Then they came up, and laid their hands on Jesus, and took him.
MAT|26|51||And lo, one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
MAT|26|52||Then Jesus said to him: Return the sword to its place; for all they that take swords, shall die by swords.
MAT|26|53||Supposest thou that I cannot ask of my Father, and he now assign me more than twelve legions of angels?
MAT|26|54||But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
MAT|26|55||At that time Jesus said to the multitude: Have ye come out, as against a cut-throat, with swords and clubs, to take me? I daily sat with you, and taught in the temple, and ye did not apprehend me.
MAT|26|56||And this occurred, that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.
MAT|26|57||And they who apprehended Jesus carried him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the Scribes and Elders were assembled.
MAT|26|58||And Simon Cephas followed after him at a distance, unto the high priest's hall, and entered, and sat with the servants within, that he might see the issue.
MAT|26|59||And the chief priests and the Elders and the whole assembly sought for witnesses against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
MAT|26|60||and found them not. And many false witnesses came; and at last, two came forward,
MAT|26|61||and said: This man said, I can destroy the temple of God, and in three days rebuild it.
MAT|26|62||And the high priest rose up and said to him: Respondest thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?
MAT|26|63||And Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered, and said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Messiah, the Son of God.
MAT|26|64||Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said. And I say to you, That hereafter ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
MAT|26|65||Then the high priest rent his clothes, and said: Behold, he hath blasphemed! Why therefore should we seek for witnesses? Behold, ye have now heard his blasphemy.
MAT|26|66||What is your pleasure? They answered and said: He is liable to death.
MAT|26|67||Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and others smote him,
MAT|26|68||and said to him: Prophesy to us, thou Messiah, who is it smote thee?
MAT|26|69||And Cephas was sitting without in the hall, and a certain maid approached him, and said to him: Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarean.
MAT|26|70||But he denied [it] before them all, and said: I know not what thou sayest.
MAT|26|71||And as he went out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them: This man was also there with Jesus the Nazarean.
MAT|26|72||And again he denied, with oaths: I know not that man.
MAT|26|73||And a little after, those standing [there] came up and said to Cephas: Certainly, thou too art one of them; and thy speech maketh thee manifest.
MAT|26|74||Then he began to imprecate and to swear, I know not that man. And in that hour the cock crew.
MAT|26|75||And Cephas remembered the declaration of Jesus, who said to him: Before the cock croweth, thou wilt three times deny me. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
MAT|27|1||And when it was morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people held a council against Jesus, how they might put him to death.
MAT|27|2||And they bound him, and carried him and delivered him up to Pilate, the president.
MAT|27|3||Then Judas the betrayer, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, repented. And he went and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders;
MAT|27|4||and said: I have sinned, by betraying innocent blood. And they said: What is that to us? See to it thyself.
MAT|27|5||And he cast down the silver in the temple, and retiring, went and strangled himself
MAT|27|6||And the chief priests took up the silver, and said: It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
MAT|27|7||And they took counsel, and bought with it the potter's field, for a place to bury strangers.
MAT|27|8||Wherefore that field is called the field of blood, unto this day.
MAT|27|9||Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I took the thirty [shekels] of silver, the price of the precious one, which they of the children of Israel had stipulated;
MAT|27|10||and I gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.
MAT|27|11||And Jesus stood before the president. And the resident asked him, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him: Thou hast said.
MAT|27|12||And when the chief priests and elders accused him, he made no reply.
MAT|27|13||Then Pilate said to him: Hearest thou not how much they testify against thee?
MAT|27|14||But he gave him no answer, not even one word: and therefore Pilate wondered greatly.
MAT|27|15||And at each festival, the president was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, such as they preferred.
MAT|27|16||And they had then in bonds a noted prisoner, called Bar Abas.
MAT|27|17||And when they were assembled, Pilate said to them: Whom will ye, that I release to you, Bar Abas, or Jesus who is called Messiah?
MAT|27|18||For Pilate knew that it was from enmity they had delivered him up.
MAT|27|19||And as the president was sitting on his tribunal, his wife sent to him, and said: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered much this day in a dream because of him.
MAT|27|20||But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should demand Bar Abas, and destroy Jesus.
MAT|27|21||And the president answered, and said to them: Which of the two, will ye, that I release to you? And they said: Bar Abas.
MAT|27|22||Pilate said to them: And what shall I do to Jesus who is called Messiah? They all replied: Let him be crucified.
MAT|27|23||The president said to them: But what hath he done, that is evil? And they cried out the more, and said: Let him be crucified.
MAT|27|24||And Pilate, when he saw that it availed nothing, but rather that tumult was produced, took water, and washed his hands before the eyes of the multitude, and said: I am pure from the blood of this just man: see ye to it.
MAT|27|25||And all the people answered, and said His blood be on us, and on our children!
MAT|27|26||Then released he to them Bar Abas; and scourged Jesus with whips and delivered him to be crucified.
MAT|27|27||Then the soldiers of the president took Jesus into the Praetorium, and assembled the whole regiment against him.
MAT|27|28||And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet military cloak.
MAT|27|29||And they wove a crown of thorns, and set it on his head, and [put] a reed in his hand, and they bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, and said: Hail, thou king of the Jews.
MAT|27|30||And they spit in his face, and took the reed, and smote him on his head.
MAT|27|31||And when they had mocked him, they divested him of the cloak, and clothed him in his own garments, and led him out to be crucified.
MAT|27|32||And as they went out, they found a man of Cyrene whose name was Simon; him they compelled to bear his cross.
MAT|27|33||And they came to a place which is called Golgotha, which is interpreted a skull.
MAT|27|34||And they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall. And he tasted [it], and would not drink.
MAT|27|35||And when they had crucified him, they distributed his garments by lot.
MAT|27|36||And they sat down, and watched him there
MAT|27|37||And they placed over his head the cause of his death, in the writing: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MAT|27|38||And there were crucified with him two robbers, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
MAT|27|39||And they that passed by reviled him, and shook their heads
MAT|27|40||and said: Destroyer of the temple, and builder of it in three days, deliver thyself, if thou art the Son of God, and come down from the cross.
MAT|27|41||So also the chief priests mocked, with the Scribes and Elders and Pharisees,
MAT|27|42||and said: He gave life to others, his own life he cannot preserve. If he is the king of Israel, let him now descend from the cross, and we will believe in him.
MAT|27|43||He trusted in God; let him rescue him now, if he hath pleasure in him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
MAT|27|44||In like manner the marauders also, that were crucified with him, reproached him.
MAT|27|45||And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour.
MAT|27|46||And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice and said: O God, O God; why hast thou forsaken me?
MAT|27|47||And some of them that stood there, when they heard [it], said: He calleth for Elijah.
MAT|27|48||And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
MAT|27|49||But the rest said: Desist; we will see if Elijah will come to rescue him.
MAT|27|50||Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
MAT|27|51||And instantly, the curtain of the door of the temple was torn asunder, from the top to the bottom; and the earth shook; and the rocks rived;
MAT|27|52||and graves were opened; and many bodies of saints who slept, arose,
MAT|27|53||and came forth; and, after his resurrection, entered into the holy city, and appeared to many.
MAT|27|54||And the centurion, and they that were with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that occurred, feared greatly, and said: Verily, this was the Son of God.
MAT|27|55||And many women were there, looking on from a distance; the same who had followed Jesus from Galilee, and had ministered to him.
MAT|27|56||One of them was Mary of Magdala, also Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
MAT|27|57||And when it was evening, there came a rich man of Ramath, whose name was a Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
MAT|27|58||This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And Pilate directed the body to be given him.
MAT|27|59||And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a winding-sheet of clean linen;
MAT|27|60||and laid it in his new sepulchre, that was excavated in a rock. And he rolled a great stone against the door of the sepulchre, and departed:
MAT|27|61||And there were present Mary of Magdala, and the other Mary, who sat over against the grave.
MAT|27|62||And on the day that was next after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate,
MAT|27|63||and said to him: Our Lord, we remember that this deceiver said, while he was alive, After three days, I shall arise
MAT|27|64||Command, therefore to guard the sepulchre; until the third day; lest his disciples come and steal him away by night, and say to the people that he hath risen from the dead; and the last delusion be worse than the first.
MAT|27|65||Pilate said to them: Ye have soldiers: go and guard it, as ye know how.
MAT|27|66||And they went and set a guard to the sepulchre, and sealed the stone.
MAT|28|1||And in the close of the sabbath, as the first [day] of the week began to dawn, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.
MAT|28|2||And lo, there was a great earthquake: for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
MAT|28|3||And his aspect was like the lightning; and his raiment white like snow:
MAT|28|4||and from fear of him the keepers were astounded, and became as dead men.
MAT|28|5||And the angel answered, and said to the women: Be not ye afraid, for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
MAT|28|6||He is not here; for he is risen, as he predicted. Come ye, see the place where our Lord was laid.
MAT|28|7||And [then] go quickly, tell his disciples, that he is risen from the dead; and lo, he precedeth you to Galilee; there will ye see him. Behold, I have told you.
MAT|28|8||And they went quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
MAT|28|9||And lo, Jesus met them, and said to them: Hail, ye. And they came and clasped his feet, and worshipped him.
MAT|28|10||Then Jesus said to them: Be not afraid; but go, tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there they will see me.
MAT|28|11||And while they were going, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had occurred.
MAT|28|12||And they assembled with the Elders, and held a council; and they gave no little money to the guards,
MAT|28|13||and said to them: Say ye, that his disciples came and stole him away by night, while we were asleep.
MAT|28|14||And if this should be reported before the President, we will pacify him, and cause you not to be troubled.
MAT|28|15||And they, having received the money, did as they were instructed. And this story is current among the Jews to this day.
MAT|28|16||And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.
MAT|28|17||And when they beheld him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
MAT|28|18||And Jesus came near, and discoursed with them, and said to them: All authority is given to me, in heaven and on earth. And as my Father sent me, so also I send you.
MAT|28|19||Go ye, therefore, and instruct all nations; and baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
MAT|28|20||And teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And, behold, I am with you always, unto the consummation of the worlds Amen.
MAK|1|1||The beginning of the gospel of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
MAK|1|2||As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way.
MAK|1|3||The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make smooth his paths.
MAK|1|4||John baptized in the wilderness, and proclaimed the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
MAK|1|5||And there went out to him all the region of Judaea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and he baptized them in the river Jordan, while they confessed their sins.
MAK|1|6||And this John was clad in raiment of camels' hair; and was girded with a cincture of skin about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
MAK|1|7||And he proclaimed, and said: Behold, after me cometh one more powerful than I, of whom I am not worthy to stoop and untie the fastenings of his shoes.
MAK|1|8||I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
MAK|1|9||And it occurred, in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized in Jordan by John.
MAK|1|10||And immediately on his coming from the water, he saw the heavens cleft, and the Spirit descending like a dove upon him.
MAK|1|11||And there was a voice from the heavens: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
MAK|1|12||And directly the Spirit carried him into the wilderness:
MAK|1|13||and he was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts; and angels ministered to him.
MAK|1|14||After John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, and proclaimed the tidings, of the kingdom of God,
MAK|1|15||and said: The time is completed, and the kingdom of God is near. Repent ye, and believe the tidings.
MAK|1|16||And as he walked near the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
MAK|1|17||And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
MAK|1|18||And immediately they left their nets, and went after him.
MAK|1|19||And as he passed on a little, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in a ship, and mending their nets.
MAK|1|20||And he called them: and immediately they left Zebedee their father in the ship, with the hired servants, and went after him.
MAK|1|21||And when they entered Capernaum, he immediately taught on the sabbath in their synagogues.
MAK|1|22||And they were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them, as having authority, and not as their Scribes.
MAK|1|23||And in their synagogue was a man, in whom was an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
MAK|1|24||and said: What have we to do with thee? Jesus thou Nazarean. Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the Holy One of God.
MAK|1|25||And Jesus rebuked him, and said: Shut thy mouth, and come out of him.
MAK|1|26||And the unclean spirit threw him down, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.
MAK|1|27||And they were all amazed, and inquired one of another, and said: What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
MAK|1|28||And immediately his fame spread into all the land of Galilee.
MAK|1|29||And he retired from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
MAK|1|30||And Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever: and they told him about her.
MAK|1|31||And he came, and took her hand, and raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.
MAK|1|32||And in the evening at the setting of the sun, they brought to him all them that were diseased, and demoniacs.
MAK|1|33||And all the city was collected at the door.
MAK|1|34||And he healed many who labored under divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
MAK|1|35||And in the morning, he rose much before others, and retired to a solitary place, and there prayed.
MAK|1|36||And Simon and his associates sought for him.
MAK|1|37||And when they found him, they said to him: Every body is seeking for thee.
MAK|1|38||And he said to them: Go into the adjacent villages and towns; for there also I will preach, because therefore have I come.
MAK|1|39||And he preached in all their synagogues, in all Galilee, and cast out demons.
MAK|1|40||And a leper came to him, and fell at his feet, and entreated him, and said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
MAK|1|41||And Jesus had compassion on him, and stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said: I will; be thou clean.
MAK|1|42||And in that hour, his leprosy departed from him, and he became clean.
MAK|1|43||And he charged him, and sent him away,
MAK|1|44||and he said to him: See that thou tell no person; but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer an oblation on account of thy purification, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
MAK|1|45||And he, as he went out, began to proclaim [it] much, and to divulge the matter; so that Jesus could not openly go into the city, but was without, in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.
MAK|2|1||And Jesus again entered into Capernaum, after some days. And when they heard that he was in the house,
MAK|2|2||many were assembled, so that [the house] could not contain them, not even before the door. And he held discourse with them.
MAK|2|3||And they came to him and brought to him a paralytic, borne between four persons.
MAK|2|4||And as they could not come near him on account of the crowd, they ascended to the roof, and removed the covering of the place where Jesus was, and let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
MAK|2|5||And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: My son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
MAK|2|6||And there were some Scribes and Pharisees there, who sat and reasoned in their hearts:
MAK|2|7||Who is this speaking, blasphemy? Who can forgive sins, except God only?
MAK|2|8||And Jesus knew, in his spirit, that they thus reasoned in themselves; and he said to them: Why reason ye thus in your heart?
MAK|2|9||Which is the easier, to say to a paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?
MAK|2|10||But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic,
MAK|2|11||I say to thee, Arise, take thy bed, and go to thy house.
MAK|2|12||And he arose in that hour, took up his bed, and departed in presence of them all: so that they were all amazed, and praised God, saying: We never saw the like.
MAK|2|13||And he went again to the sea; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
MAK|2|14||And as he passed along he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting among the publicans. And he said to him: Come after me. And he arose and went after him.
MAK|2|15||And it was so, that as he reclined in his [Levi's] house, many publicans and sinners reclined with Jesus and with his disciples: for they were many, and they followed him.
MAK|2|16||And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw that he ate with publicans and with sinners, they said to his disciples: Why doth he eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
MAK|2|17||When Jesus heard [it], he said to them: The healthy need not a physician, but those laboring under disease: I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners.
MAK|2|18||And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasters; and they came and said to him: Why are the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fasters, and thy disciples fast not?
MAK|2|19||Jesus said to them: Can the guests of the nuptial chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? No.
MAK|2|20||But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast, in that day.
MAK|2|21||No one taketh a patch of new cloth and seweth it upon an old garment, lest the supplemental new should take from the old, and the rent become the greater.
MAK|2|22||And no one putteth new wine into old sacks, lest the wine burst the sacks, and the sacks be spoiled, and the wine spilled; but they put new wine into new sacks.
MAK|2|23||And it was so, that as Jesus on a sabbath walked in the tillage grounds, his disciples walked and plucked the ears.
MAK|2|24||And the Pharisees said to him: See, how on the sabbath, they do that which is not lawful?
MAK|2|25||Jesus said to them: Have ye never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he and his attendants?
MAK|2|26||How he entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Lord's table, which it was not lawful for any but priests to eat, and gave [it] also to those with him?
MAK|2|27||And he said to them: The sabbath was made on man's account, and not man for the sake of the sabbath.
MAK|2|28||Therefore also the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
MAK|3|1||And again Jesus entered into a synagogue. And there was a man there, whose hand was withered.
MAK|3|2||And they watched him, that if he should heal on the sabbath, they might accuse him.
MAK|3|3||And he said to the man of the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.
MAK|3|4||And he said also to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to give life to a person, or to destroy? But they were silent
MAK|3|5||And he looked on them with indignation, being grieved with the hardness of their heart. And he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched forth, and his hand was restored.
MAK|3|6||And the Pharisees went out, that very hour, with the domestics of Herod, and held a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.
MAK|3|7||And Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea. And many people joined him from Galilee, and from Judaea,
MAK|3|8||and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan, and from Tyre, and from Sidon: great multitudes,--- when they heard all that he did, came to him.
MAK|3|9||And he told his disciples to bring him a ship, on account of the multitude, lest they should crowd upon him
MAK|3|10||For he had healed many, so that they rushed upon him, in order to touch him.
MAK|3|11||And they who were afflicted with unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down and cried out, and said: Thou art the Son of God.
MAK|3|12||And he charged them much, not to make him known.
MAK|3|13||And he ascended a mountain, and called whom he pleased; and they came to him.
MAK|3|14||And he chose twelve to be with him, whom he would send out to preach,
MAK|3|15||and who would have power to heal the sick, and to cast out demons.
MAK|3|16||And to Simon he gave the name of Cephas.
MAK|3|17||And to James the son of Zebedee and to John the brother of James, he gave the name of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder.
MAK|3|18||And [he chose also] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
MAK|3|19||And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And they came to the house:
MAK|3|20||and the multitude assembled again, so that they could not eat bread.
MAK|3|21||And his kinsmen heard, and went out to take him; for they said: He is out of his reason.
MAK|3|22||And those Scribes that had come down from Jerusalem, said: Beelzebub is in him; and by the prince of demons he expelleth demons.
MAK|3|23||And Jesus called them, and said to them, by similitudes: How can Satan cast out Satan?
MAK|3|24||For if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
MAK|3|25||And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
MAK|3|26||And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided, he cannot stand, but is at an end.
MAK|3|27||No one can enter the house of a strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he may rob his house.
MAK|3|28||Verily I say to you: All sins, and the blasphemies that men may utter, may be forgiven them:
MAK|3|29||but whoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, to him for ever there is no forgiveness; but he is obnoxious to eternal judgment.
MAK|3|30||Because they had said: An unclean spirit is in him.
MAK|3|31||And his mother and his brothers came, and, standing without, sent to call him to them.
MAK|3|32||And the multitude were sitting around him, and they said to him: Lo, thy mother and thy brothers, without, call for thee.
MAK|3|33||He replied, and said to them: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?
MAK|3|34||And he looked upon those who sat by him, and said: Behold my mother! and, behold my brothers!
MAK|3|35||For whoever shall do the pleasure of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.
MAK|4|1||And again he began to teach by the side of the sea. And great multitudes were assembled about him; so that he embarked and sat in a ship on the sea, and all the multitude stood on the land by the side of the sea.
MAK|4|2||And he taught them much by similitudes. And in his teaching, he said:
MAK|4|3||Hear ye: Behold a sower went forth to sow.
MAK|4|4||And as he sowed, some [seed] fell on the side of the path; and a bird came, and devoured it.
MAK|4|5||And other [seed] fell on a rock, so that it had not much earth; and it soon shot up, because it had no depth of earth.
MAK|4|6||But when the sun was up, it wilted; and because it had no root, it dried up.
MAK|4|7||And other [seed] fell among thorns. And the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruits.
MAK|4|8||And other [seed] fell on good ground, and came up, and grew, and yielded fruits; some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.
MAK|4|9||And he said: Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAK|4|10||And when they were by themselves, those with him, together with the twelve, asked him [concerning] this similitude.
MAK|4|11||And Jesus said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them without, all is in similitudes:
MAK|4|12||that when they see, they may see and not see, and when they hear, they may hear and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.
MAK|4|13||And he said to them: Do ye not understand this similitude? And how will ye understand all similitudes?
MAK|4|14||The sower that sowed, sowed the word.
MAK|4|15||And those by the side of the path, are they in whom the word is sown; and as soon as they have heard [it], Satan cometh, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
MAK|4|16||And those sown on the rock, are they who, when they hear the word, immediately with joy receive it.
MAK|4|17||And they have no root in them, but are temporary; and when there is affliction or persecution on account of the word, they are quickly stumbled.
MAK|4|18||And those sown among thorns, are they that hear the word,
MAK|4|19||and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the residue of other lusts enter in and choke the word, and it is without fruits.
MAK|4|20||And those sown on good ground are they that hear the word, and receive it, and bear fruits, by thirties, and by sixties, and by hundreds.
MAK|4|21||And he said to them: Is a lamp brought to be placed under a bushel, or under a bed? Is it not to be placed on a light-stand?
MAK|4|22||For there is nothing hid, which will not be exposed; and nothing concealed, which will not be made manifest.
MAK|4|23||If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.
MAK|4|24||And he said to them: Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you: and there shall more be given to you who hear.
MAK|4|25||For to him that hath, will more be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath, will be taken from him.
MAK|4|26||And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,
MAK|4|27||and should sleep and rise, by night and by day, and the seed should grow and shoot up, he knoweth not how.
MAK|4|28||For the earth bringeth forth the fruit; first the plant, and subsequently the ear, and at last the complete wheat in the ear.
MAK|4|29||And when the fruit is ripe, immediately cometh the sickle, because the harvest hath arrived.
MAK|4|30||And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? and with what similitude shall we compare it?
MAK|4|31||It is like a grain of mustard seed which, when it is sown in the earth, is the least of all seeds sown on the earth;
MAK|4|32||and when it is sown it springeth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and produceth great branches, so that birds can lodge under its shadow.
MAK|4|33||And by many such similitudes,---similitudes such as they could hear,---Jesus discoursed with the people.
MAK|4|34||And without similitudes he did not converse with them: but to his disciples, between himself and them, he explained every thing.
MAK|4|35||And he said to them, the same day at evening: Let us pass over to the other side.
MAK|4|36||And they sent away the multitudes: and they conducted him in the ship as he was. And there were also with him other little ships.
MAK|4|37||And there was a great tempest and wind: and the waves beat upon the ship, and it was near being filled.
MAK|4|38||And Jesus was asleep on a pillow in the hinder part of the ship. And they came and awoke him, and said to him: Our Rabbi, carest thou not, that we perish?
MAK|4|39||And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Cease; be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
MAK|4|40||And he said to them: Why were ye so fearful? and why have ye not faith?
MAK|4|41||And they feared with great fear: and they said, one to another: Who is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
MAK|5|1||And he came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.
MAK|5|2||And as he went out of the ship, there met him from the place of sepulchres a man in whom was an unclean spirit.
MAK|5|3||And he dwelt in the place of sepulchres; and no one could confine him with chains:
MAK|5|4||because, as often as he had been confined with fetters and chains, he had broken the chains and burst the fetters: and no one could subdue him.
MAK|5|5||And continually, by night and by day, he was in the place of sepulchres, and cried and wounded himself with stones.
MAK|5|6||And when he saw Jesus at a distance, he ran and worshipped him;
MAK|5|7||and cried with a loud voice, and said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
MAK|5|8||For he had said to him: Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
MAK|5|9||And he demanded of him: What is thy name? And he replied to him: Our name is Legion; for we are many.
MAK|5|10||And he besought him much, that he would not send him out of the country.
MAK|5|11||And there was there by the mountain, a great herd of swine grazing.
MAK|5|12||And the demons besought him, and said: Send us upon those swine, that we may enter them.
MAK|5|13||And he permitted them. And those unclean spirits went out, and entered the swine: and the herd, of about two thousand, ran to a precipice, and fell into the sea, and were strangled in the waters.
MAK|5|14||And they who tended them, fled and told [it] in the city and in the villages: and they came out to see what had occurred.
MAK|5|15||And: they came to Jesus, and saw him in whom the demons had been,---him in whom had been the legion,--- clothed, and sober, and sitting; and they were afraid.
MAK|5|16||And those who had seen [it] told them how it occurred to him who had the demons, and also concerning the swine.
MAK|5|17||And they began to request him, that he would go from their border.
MAK|5|18||And as he ascended the ship, the late demoniac requested that he might continue with him.
MAK|5|19||And he suffered him not, but said to him: Go home to thy people, and tell them what the Lord hath done for thee, and hath compassionated thee.
MAK|5|20||And he went, and began to publish in Decapolis, what Jesus had done for him. And they were all amazed.
MAK|5|21||And when Jesus had passed by ship to the other side, great multitudes again assembled about him as he was on the shore of the sea.
MAK|5|22||And one of the rulers of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came, and, on seeing him, fell at his feet,
MAK|5|23||and besought him much, and said to him: My daughter is very sick; but come and lay thy hand on her, and she will be cured, and will live.
MAK|5|24||And Jesus went with him; and a great company attended him, and pressed upon him.
MAK|5|25||And a woman who had had a defluxion of blood twelve years,
MAK|5|26||and who had suffered much from many physicians, and had expended all she possessed, and was not profited, but was even the more afflicted;
MAK|5|27||when she heard of Jesus, came behind him in the press of the crowd, and touched his garment
MAK|5|28||For she said: If I but touch his garment, I shall live.
MAK|5|29||And immediately the fountain of her blood dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.
MAK|5|30||And Jesus at once knew in himself, that virtue had issued from him: and he turned to the throng, and said: Who touched my clothes?
MAK|5|31||And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the throngs that press upon thee; and sayest thou, Who touched me?
MAK|5|32||And he looked around, to see who had done this.
MAK|5|33||And the woman, fearing and trembling, for she knew what had taken place in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
MAK|5|34||And he said to her: My daughter, thy faith hath made thee live: go in peace; and be thou healed of thy plague.
MAK|5|35||And while he was speaking, some domestics of the ruler of the synagogue came, and said: Thy daughter is dead: why therefore troublest thou the teacher?
MAK|5|36||But Jesus heard the word they spoke, and said to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not; only believe.
MAK|5|37||And he suffered no one to go with him, except Simon Cephas, and James, and John the brother of James.
MAK|5|38||And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he saw, that they were in a tumult, and weeping, and howling.
MAK|5|39||And he entered in and said to them: Why are ye in a tumult, and weep? The maid is not dead, but is asleep.
MAK|5|40||And they laughed at him. But Jesus put them all out. And he took the maids father, and her mother, and those that accompanied him, and entered into where the maid lay.
MAK|5|41||And he took the maid's hand, and said to her: Maiden, arise.
MAK|5|42||And immediately the maid arose, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
MAK|5|43||And he enjoined it upon them much, that no one should know of it. And he directed, that they should give her to eat.
MAK|6|1||And Jesus departed from there and came to his own city, and his disciples attended him.
MAK|6|2||And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard [him] were astonished, and said: Whence hath he obtained these things? And, what wisdom is this, which is given to him! and that such mighty works are done by his hands!
MAK|6|3||Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and of Joses and of Judas and of Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were stumbled in him.
MAK|6|4||And Jesus said to them: There is no prophet who is little, except in his own city, and among his kindred, and at home.
MAK|6|5||And he could not there do even one mighty work, except that he laid his hand on a few sick, and healed them.
MAK|6|6||And he wondered at the defect of their faith. And he travelled about the villages and taught.
MAK|6|7||And he called his twelve, and began to send them forth, two and two; and he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out.
MAK|6|8||And he commanded them to take nothing for the journey, except a staff only; neither a wallet, nor bread, nor brass in their purses;
MAK|6|9||but to be shod with sandals, and not put on two coats.
MAK|6|10||And he said to them: Into whatever house ye enter, there abide till ye leave the place.
MAK|6|11||And whoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when ye go out from that place shake off the dust that is under your feet, for a testimony to them. Verily I say to you, There will be comfort for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment rather than for that city.
MAK|6|12||And they went out and proclaimed, that [men] should repent.
MAK|6|13||And they cast out many demons, and many of the sick they anointed with oil, and healed them.
MAK|6|14||And Herod the king heard of Jesus,---for his name had become known to him,---and he said: John the Baptizer hath risen from the dead: and therefore it is, mighty deeds are done by him.
MAK|6|15||Others said: He is Elijah: and others: He is a prophet, like one of the prophets.
MAK|6|16||But when Herod heard [of him], he said: He is that John whose head I struck off: he is risen from the dead.
MAK|6|17||For Herod had sent and seized John and bound him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philips wife, whom he had taken.
MAK|6|18||For John had said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to take thy brother's wife.
MAK|6|19||And Herodias herself was an enemy to him, and wished to kill him, but was not able.
MAK|6|20||For Herod was afraid of John, because he knew him to be a just and holy man: and he observed him, and gave ear to him in many things and did [the things], and he heard him with satisfaction.
MAK|6|21||And there was a noted day, when Herod made a supper, in the house of his nativity, for his nobles and the chiliarchs and the chiefs of Galilee.
MAK|6|22||And the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced; and she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. And the king said to the maid: Ask of me what thou pleasest, and I will give it thee.
MAK|6|23||And he swore to her: Whatever thou shalt ask, I will give thee, even to the half of my kingdom.
MAK|6|24||And she went out, and said to her mother: What shall I ask of him? She said to her: The head of John the Baptizer.
MAK|6|25||And she soon entered with eagerness to the king, and said: I desire that thou, this hour, give me in a dish the head of John the Baptizer.
MAK|6|26||And it pained the king greatly; yet, on account of the oath, and on account of the guests, he would not deny her:
MAK|6|27||and the king sent immediately an executioner, and commanded [him] to bring the head of John. And he went, and struck off the head of John in the prison;
MAK|6|28||and brought it on a dish, and gave it to the maid; and the maid gave it to her mother.
MAK|6|29||And his disciples heard [of it]; and they came and took up the corpse, and laid it in a sepulchre.
MAK|6|30||And the legates assembled before Jesus, and told him all they had done, and all they had taught.
MAK|6|31||And he said to them: Come, let us go into a desert by ourselves, and rest a little. For there were many going and coming, and they had not opportunity even to eat bread.
MAK|6|32||And they went by ship to a desert place by themselves.
MAK|6|33||But many saw them, as they departed, and knew them; and from all the cities, they ran thither by land before him.
MAK|6|34||And Jesus disembarked and saw great multitudes: and he compassionated them, because they were like sheep having no shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
MAK|6|35||And when the time was advanced, his disciples came to him, and said to him: This is a desert place, and the time is advanced.
MAK|6|36||Dismiss them, that they may go into the fields around us and into the villages, and may buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
MAK|6|37||And he said to them: Give ye them to eat. They say to him: Shall we go and buy bread of the value of two hundred denarii, and give them to eat?
MAK|6|38||And he said to them: Go, see how many loaves ye have here. And when they had seen, they say to him: Five loaves and two fishes.
MAK|6|39||And he bid them make the people recline on the grass by companies.
MAK|6|40||And they reclined, by companies of a hundred, and of fifty.
MAK|6|41||And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked towards heaven, and blessed and brake the bread, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and they divided [also] the two fishes among them all.
MAK|6|42||And they all ate, and were satisfied.
MAK|6|43||And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.
MAK|6|44||And they who had eaten bread were five thousand men.
MAK|6|45||And he immediately constrained his disciples to take ship, and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the multitudes.
MAK|6|46||And when he had dismissed them, he went to a mountain to pray.
MAK|6|47||And when evening came, the ship was in the middle of the sea, and he alone on the land.
MAK|6|48||And he saw them straining themselves in rowing; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them walking on the waters; and he was disposed to pass by them.
MAK|6|49||And they saw him walking on the waters, and they supposed that the appearance was a spectre: and they cried out.
MAK|6|50||For they all saw him, and were afraid. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Take courage; it is I; fear not.
MAK|6|51||And he entered into the ship to them; and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed, and astonished among themselves.
MAK|6|52||For they did not learn by the bread; because their heart was stupid.
MAK|6|53||And when they had passed to the other shore, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
MAK|6|54||And when they went out of the ship, immediately the men of the place knew him.
MAK|6|55||And they ran through all that region, and began to bring forth them that were sick, bearing them on beds to where they heard he was.
MAK|6|56||And wherever he entered into villages or cities, the sick were laid in he streets: and they besought him, that they might touch but the extremity of his raiment. And all they that touched him, were healed.
MAK|7|1||And there gathered about him Pharisees and Scribes, who had come from Jerusalem.
MAK|7|2||And they saw some of his disciples eating bread, with their hands unwashed; and they censured it.
MAK|7|3||For all the Jews and the Pharisees, unless they carefully wash their hands do not eat; because they hold fast the tradition of the Elders.
MAK|7|4||And [coming] from the market-place, except they baptize, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they have received to observe, [such as] the baptisms of cups, and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of couches.
MAK|7|5||And the Scribes and Pharisees asked him: Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the Elders, but eat bread with their hands unwashed?
MAK|7|6||And he said to them: Well did Isaiah the prophet prophecy concerning you, ye hypocrites; as it is written: This people honoreth me with its lips, but their heart is very far from me.
MAK|7|7||And in vain do they give me reverence, while teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.
MAK|7|8||For ye have forsaken the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men, the baptisms of cups, and of pots, and many things like these.
MAK|7|9||He said [also] to them: Full well do ye spurn the precept of God, that ye may establish your tradition!
MAK|7|10||For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and whoever shall revile his father or his mother, shall surely die.
MAK|7|11||But ye say: If a man say to his father or to his mother, Be it my oblation, whatever thou mayest gain from me:
MAK|7|12||then ye suffer him not to do any thing for his father or his mother.
MAK|7|13||And ye reject the word of God, on account of the tradition which ye hand down. And many things like these, ye do.
MAK|7|14||And Jesus called all the multitude, and said to them: Hear, all ye; and understand.
MAK|7|15||There is nothing without a man which, by entering him, can pollute him. But that which cometh out of him, that it is that polluteth a man.
MAK|7|16||Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAK|7|17||And when Jesus had entered the house, apart from the multitude, his disciples asked him about this similitude.
MAK|7|18||And he said to them: Are ye likewise so undiscerning? Do ye not know, that whatever from without entereth into a man, cannot defile him?
MAK|7|19||For it doth not enter into his heart, but into his belly, and is thrown into the digestive process, which carries off all that is eaten.
MAK|7|20||But that which proceedeth from a man, that defileth a man.
MAK|7|21||For from within, from the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adultery, whoredom,
MAK|7|22||theft, murder, avarice, malice, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, reviling, haughtiness, folly.
MAK|7|23||All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.
MAK|7|24||Thence Jesus arose, and went to the border of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and wished no man to know him; but he could not be concealed.
MAK|7|25||For immediately a woman, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him; and she came, and fell before his feet,
MAK|7|26||the woman was a Gentile from Phenicia of Syria, and besought him, that he would expel the demon from her daughter.
MAK|7|27||Jesus said to her: Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not becoming, to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs.
MAK|7|28||And she replied, and said to him: Yes, my Lord: and yet the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.
MAK|7|29||Jesus said to her: Go thou; because of this speech, the demon hath departed from thy daughter.
MAK|7|30||And she went to her house, and found her daughter lying on a bed, and the demon gone from her.
MAK|7|31||Again Jesus departed from the border of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, to the border of Decapolis.
MAK|7|32||And they brought to him a deaf and stammering man, and besought him to lay his hand on him.
MAK|7|33||And he led him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and spit, and touched his tongue,
MAK|7|34||and looked towards heaven, and sighed, and said to him: Be opened.
MAK|7|35||And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plainly.
MAK|7|36||And he charged them to tell no man of it: and the more he charged them, the more they proclaimed it.
MAK|7|37||And they admired exceedingly, and said: He doeth every thing excellently: he maketh the deaf to hear, and the speechless to talk.
MAK|8|1||And in those days, when the multitude was great, and had nothing to eat, he called his disciples, and said to them:
MAK|8|2||I compassionate this multitude; for, lo, three days have they continued with me, and they have nothing to eat.
MAK|8|3||And if I send them to their homes fasting, they will faint by the way: for some of them have come from a great distance.
MAK|8|4||His disciples say to him: Whence can one, here in the desert, satisfy all these with bread?
MAK|8|5||And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? They say to him, Seven.
MAK|8|6||And he directed the multitudes to recline on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and blessed, and brake, and grave to his disciples to set forth; and they set before the multitudes.
MAK|8|7||And there were a few fishes; and them he also blessed, and ordered them set forth.
MAK|8|8||And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
MAK|8|9||And the men who had eaten, were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
MAK|8|10||And immediately he entered a ship, with his disciples, and came to the place Dalmanutha.
MAK|8|11||And the Pharisees came out, and began to dispute with him; and, to tempt him, they demanded of him a sign from heaven.
MAK|8|12||And he sighed with his breath, and said: Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say to you, No sign will be given to this generation.
MAK|8|13||And he left them, and embarked in the ship; and they passed to the other shore.
MAK|8|14||And they had forgotten to take bread with them, and had but a single cake in the ship with them.
MAK|8|15||And he charged them, and said to them: Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
MAK|8|16||And they reasoned one with another, and said: It is, because we have no bread.
MAK|8|17||And Jesus knew [it], and said to them: Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? Do ye still not know, nor understand? How long will your heart be hard?
MAK|8|18||and ye have eyes, but see not? and have ears, but hear not, nor reflect?
MAK|8|19||When I broke the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of the fragments took ye up? They say to him: Twelve.
MAK|8|20||He saith to them. And when the seven to four thousand, how many baskets full of the fragments took ye up? They say: Seven.
MAK|8|21||He saith to them: Why is it that, to this time, ye do not consider?
MAK|8|22||And he came to Bethsaida: and they brought to him a blind man, and besought him to touch him.
MAK|8|23||And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village, and spit on his eyes, and laid on his hand: and asked him, what he saw.
MAK|8|24||And he gazed, and said: I see men like trees which walk.
MAK|8|25||Again he laid his hand on his eyes, and he was recovered, and saw every thing plainly.
MAK|8|26||And he sent him to his house, and said to him: Neither enter into the village, nor tell any person in the village.
MAK|8|27||And Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And he asked his disciples by the way, and said to them: Who, do men say of me, that I am?
MAK|8|28||And they said to him: That [thou art] John the Baptizer; and others: That [thou art] Elijah; and others: That [thou art] one of the prophets.
MAK|8|29||Jesus said to them: And who, do ye yourselves say of me, that I am? Simon replied, and said to him: Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
MAK|8|30||And he charged them, that they should say [this] of him to no person.
MAK|8|31||And he began to teach them, that the Son of man was about to suffer much, and be rejected by the Elders and by the chief priests and by the Scribes, and be killed, and rise on the third day.
MAK|8|32||And he spoke out the thing distinctly. And Cephas took him, and began to rebuke him.
MAK|8|33||But he turned, and looked upon his disciples, and rebuked Simon, and said: Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou dost not consider what is of God, but what is of men.
MAK|8|34||And Jesus called the multitude, together with his disciples, and said to them: Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and come after me.
MAK|8|35||For, whoever will preserve his life, shall lose it; and whoever will lose his life on my account, and on account of my tidings, shall preserve it.
MAK|8|36||For, what will a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his life?
MAK|8|37||Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
MAK|8|38||For, whoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this sinful and adulterous generation, of him also will the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels.
MAK|9|1||And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There are some standing here, who will not taste of death, until they shall see the kingdom of God to be coming with power.
MAK|9|2||And after six days, Jesus took Cephas and James and John, and led them to a high mountain, apart; and was transformed before them.
MAK|9|3||And his raiment shone and was very white, like snow, so as men on earth can never whiten.
MAK|9|4||And there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, in conversation with Jesus.
MAK|9|5||And Cephas said to him: Rabbi, it is delightful for us to be here. And let us make three booths; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
MAK|9|6||But he did not know what he said, for they were in trepidation.
MAK|9|7||And there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them. And a voice issued from the cloud, which said: This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.
MAK|9|8||And suddenly, when the disciples looked up, they saw no one with them, except Jesus only.
MAK|9|9||And as they descended the mountain, he commanded them to tell no man what they had seen, till after the Son of man should be risen from the dead.
MAK|9|10||And they kept that saying in their mind; and inquired, What doth this saying mean: "When he shall be risen from the dead!"
MAK|9|11||And they asked him, and said: Why then do the Scribes say, that Elijah must first come?
MAK|9|12||He said to them: Elijah [truly] first cometh, to prepare all things: and, as it is written of the Son of man, he will suffer much, and be rejected.
MAK|9|13||But I say to you: That Elijah hath come; and they have done to him all that they desired, as it was written of him.
MAK|9|14||And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude with them, and the Scribes disputing with them.
MAK|9|15||And immediately the multitude saw him, and were surprised: and they ran and saluted him.
MAK|9|16||And he asked the Scribes: What were ye disputing with them?
MAK|9|17||And one of the multitude replied, and said: Teacher, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a spirit that will not speak.
MAK|9|18||And wherever he seizeth him, he shaketh and teareth him: and he gnasheth his teeth, and pineth away. And I spoke to thy disciples, to cast him out; and they could not.
MAK|9|19||Jesus answered, and said to them: O incredulous generation! How long shall I be with you? how long bear with you? Bring him to me.
MAK|9|20||And they brought him to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately he shook him; and he fell upon the ground, and wallowed and foamed.
MAK|9|21||And Jesus asked his father, how long a time he had been thus. He said to him: Lo, from his childhood.
MAK|9|22||And many times it hath thrown him into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him. But, if thou canst do any thing, aid me and have compassion on me.
MAK|9|23||Jesus said to him: If thou canst believe; every thing can be, to him that believeth.
MAK|9|24||And immediately the father of the child cried out, while he wept and said: I believe; aid thou the defect of my faith.
MAK|9|25||And when Jesus saw that the people were, running and collecting around him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to him: Thou deaf and unspeaking spirit, I command thee, come out of him; and no more enter him.
MAK|9|26||And the demon cried out greatly, and bruised him, and came out. And he was as a dead person; so that many would say, he is dead.
MAK|9|27||And Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up.
MAK|9|28||And when Jesus entered the house, his disciples asked him privately: Why could not we cast him out?
MAK|9|29||He saith to them: This kind can come out, by nothing but fasting and prayer.
MAK|9|30||And when he departed from there, they passed through Galilee: and he desired that no one might know him.
MAK|9|31||For he taught his disciples, and said to them: The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day, he will rise.
MAK|9|32||But they did not understand that speech; and they were afraid to ask him.
MAK|9|33||And they came to Capernaum. And when they entered the house, he asked them: What disputed ye among yourselves by the way?
MAK|9|34||And they were silent; for by the way they had contended with one another, which should be the great among them.
MAK|9|35||And Jesus sat down, and called the twelve, and said to them: Whoever would be first, let him be last of all, and servitor to all.
MAK|9|36||And he took a child, and set him in the midst, and took him in his arms and said to them:
MAK|9|37||Whoever receiveth one in my name, like this child, he receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth not me [only], but him that sent me.
MAK|9|38||John said to him: Rabbi, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he adhereth not to us.
MAK|9|39||Jesus said to them: Forbid him not; for there is no one who doeth mighty works in my name, that can readily speak evil of me.
MAK|9|40||Whoever therefore is not against you, is for you.
MAK|9|41||For whoever shall give you to drink a cup of water only, on the ground that ye are Messiah's [followers], verily I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
MAK|9|42||And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me to stumble, it were better for him, if a millstone were put to his neck, and he cast into the sea.
MAK|9|43||And if thy hand make thee offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than, having two hands, to go into hell;
MAK|9|44||where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not extinguished.
MAK|9|45||And if thy foot make thee offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life lamed, than, having two feet, to fall into hell;
MAK|9|46||where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not extinguished.
MAK|9|47||And if thy eye make thee offend, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter with one eye into the kingdom of God, than, having two eyes, to fall into the hell of fire;
MAK|9|48||where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not extinguished.
MAK|9|49||For every thing will be salted with fire; and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.
MAK|9|50||Salt is a good thing: but if the salt become insipid, with what will it be salted? Let there be salt in you: and be ye in peace, one with another.
MAK|10|1||And he arose from there, and came to the border of Judaea, on the other side the Jordan. And great multitudes came to him there; and again he instructed them, as he was accustomed.
MAK|10|2||And the Pharisees came to him, and, tempting him, inquired if it were lawful for a man to divorce his wife.
MAK|10|3||He said to them: What did Moses command you?
MAK|10|4||They said: Moses permitted us to write a bill of divorce, and send [her] away.
MAK|10|5||Jesus answered and said to them: On account of the hardness of your heart, Moses wrote you this precept.
MAK|10|6||But, from the beginning, God made them a male and a female.
MAK|10|7||Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and adhere to his wife:
MAK|10|8||and they two shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are not two, but one flesh.
MAK|10|9||What therefore God hath conjoined, let not man separate.
MAK|10|10||And in the house, the disciples asked him again of this matter.
MAK|10|11||And he said to them: Whoever shall divorce his wife, and take another, committeth adultery.
MAK|10|12||And if a woman shall leave her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.
MAK|10|13||And they brought little children to him, that he might touch them. But his disciples rebuked those who brought them.
MAK|10|14||And when Jesus saw it, he was displeased; and he said to them, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of those like them is the kingdom of God.
MAK|10|15||Verily I say to you, That whoever doth not receive the kingdom of God, like a little child, shall not enter it.
MAK|10|16||And he took them in his arms, and laid his hand on them and blessed them.
MAK|10|17||And as he walked in the way, one ran and fell upon his knees, and asked him, and said: Good Teacher, what must I do, to inherit eternal life?
MAK|10|18||Jesus saith to him: Why callest thou me good? There is none good, but one, God.
MAK|10|19||Thou knowest the commandments; thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not give false testimony, thou shalt not defraud; honor thy father and thy mother.
MAK|10|20||And he answered, and said to him: Teacher, all these have I kept from my childhood.
MAK|10|21||And Jesus looked on him, and loved him, and said to him: One thing thou lackest. Go, sell all that thou possessest, and give to the poor, and there will be a treasure for thee in heaven; and take thy cross, and come after me.
MAK|10|22||And he was made sad by that speech, and went away sorrowing: for he possessed great riches.
MAK|10|23||And Jesus looked upon his disciples, and said to them: How hard for those who possess wealth, to enter into the kingdom of God!
MAK|10|24||And the disciples wondered at the remark. And Jesus, replied again, and said to them: My children, how hard it is, for those who trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God.
MAK|10|25||It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
MAK|10|26||And they wondered the more, and said among themselves: Who can obtain life!
MAK|10|27||And Jesus looked on them again, and said to them: With men, this is not possible, but with God [it is]; for with God all things are possible.
MAK|10|28||And Cephas began to say: Lo, we have left every thing, and have cleaved to thee.
MAK|10|29||Jesus answered and said: Verily I say to you, There is no man that leaveth houses, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children, for my sake, and for the sake of my tidings,
MAK|10|30||who will not receive a hundredfold, here in the present time,---houses, and brothers and sisters, and mothers and children, and lands, with persecution; and in the world to come eternal life.
MAK|10|31||But many are first, who will be last; and last, [who will be] first.
MAK|10|32||And as they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem, Jesus went before them: and they were amazed, and walked after him with trembling. And he took his twelve, and began to tell them what was to befall him.
MAK|10|33||Behold, we are going to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and the Scribes; and they will condemn him to die, and will deliver him over to the Gentiles.
MAK|10|34||And they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will spit in his face, and will kill him; and on the third day he will arise.
MAK|10|35||And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him, and said to him: Teacher, we desire that thou wouldst do for us all that we ask.
MAK|10|36||He saith to them: What would ye, that I should do for you?
MAK|10|37||They say to him: Grant to us, that one may sit on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy glory.
MAK|10|38||But he said to them: Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup, of which I drink? and to be baptized with the baptism, that I am baptized with?
MAK|10|39||They say to him: We are able. Jesus saith to them: The cup that I drink, ye will drink, and the baptism that I am baptized with, ye will be baptized with:
MAK|10|40||But that ye should sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, except to those for whom it is prepared.
MAK|10|41||And when the ten heard [it], they began to murmur against James and John.
MAK|10|42||And Jesus called them, and said to them: Ye know, that they who are accounted chiefs of the nations, are their lords; and their great men have authority over them.
MAK|10|43||But it shall not be so among you: but he that would be great among you, must be a servitor to you.
MAK|10|44||And he of you that would be first, must be servant to every one.
MAK|10|45||And also the Son of man came, not to be served, but to serve; and to give his life a ransom for many.
MAK|10|46||And they came to Jericho. And as Jesus went out of Jericho, he and his disciples and a great multitude; Timeus, the son of Timeus, a blind man, was sitting by the side of the way, and begging.
MAK|10|47||And he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarean; and he began to cry out, and to say: Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MAK|10|48||And many rebuked him, that he might be silent. But he cried out the more, and said: Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MAK|10|49||And Jesus stood, and directed him to be called. And they called the blind man, and said to him: Take courage: arise, he calleth thee.
MAK|10|50||And the blind man cast off his garment and arose, and went to Jesus.
MAK|10|51||Jesus said to him: What wilt thou, that I do for thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabbi, that I may have sight.
MAK|10|52||And Jesus said to him: Go; thy faith hath procured thee life. And immediately his sight was restored; and he followed after him.
MAK|11|1||And as they approached Jerusalem, near by Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
MAK|11|2||and said to them: Go ye to the village that is over against us, and as soon as ye enter it, ye will find a colt tied, on which no person hath ridden: loose [him], and bring him hither.
MAK|11|3||And, if any one say to you, Why do ye this? Say ye to him: Because our Lord hath need of him. And immediately he will send him hither.
MAK|11|4||And they went, and they found the colt tied, by the door, without in the street. And as they were loosing [him],
MAK|11|5||some of those standing there, said to them: What do ye, untying the colt?
MAK|11|6||And they said to them, as Jesus had commanded them; and they permitted them.
MAK|11|7||And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments upon him, and set Jesus upon him.
MAK|11|8||And many spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.
MAK|11|9||And those preceding him, and those following him shouted and said: Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
MAK|11|10||And blessed is the advancing kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest [heavens].
MAK|11|11||And Jesus entered Jerusalem and the temple, and surveyed every thing. And when evening arrived, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
MAK|11|12||And the following day, as he left Bethany, he was hungry:
MAK|11|13||and he saw a fig-tree at a distance, on which were leaves, and he came to it, if he could find somewhat on it. And when he had come, he found on it only leaves; for the time of figs had not arrived.
MAK|11|14||And he said to it: Henceforth and for ever, let no man eat fruit from thee: and the disciples heard it. And they came to Jerusalem.
MAK|11|15||And Jesus entered the temple of God: and he began to cast out those who bought and sold in the temple; and he overturned the counters of the money-brokers, and the seats of them that sold doves.
MAK|11|16||And he suffered no one to carry goods through the temple.
MAK|11|17||And he taught them, and said: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations? But ye have made it a den of robbers.
MAK|11|18||And the chief priests and the Scribes heard [him], and they sought how they might destroy him; for they were afraid of him, because all the people admired his doctrine.
MAK|11|19||And when it was evening, they went out from the city.
MAK|11|20||And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up, as it were, from its root.
MAK|11|21||And Simon remembered, and said to him: Rabbi; behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst, is dried up.
MAK|11|22||And Jesus replied, and said to them: Have faith in God.
MAK|11|23||Verily I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and fall into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he said will occur, to him will be the thing he spoke.
MAK|11|24||Therefore I say to you, That whatsoever ye shall pray and ask for, believe that it will be, and it will be to you.
MAK|11|25||And when ye stand up to pray, forgive what ye have against any one; that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive your offences.
MAK|11|26||For if ye forgive not, your Father also who is in heaven will not forgive you your offences.
MAK|11|27||And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and Scribes and Elders came to him,
MAK|11|28||and said to him: By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee the authority to do these things?
MAK|11|29||And Jesus said to them: I also will ask you one thing, that ye may tell me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAK|11|30||The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or from men? Tell me.
MAK|11|31||And they reasoned with themselves, and said: If we should say to him, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
MAK|11|32||But if we should say, From men; there is fear from the people; for they have all held John to be truly a prophet.
MAK|11|33||And they answered, and said to Jesus: We do not know. He said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAK|12|1||And he began to discourse with them in similitudes. A certain man planted a vineyard, and inclosed it with a hedge, and dug in it a wine vat, and built a tower in it, and put it into the hands of husbandmen, and removed to a distance.
MAK|12|2||And at the proper time, he sent his servant to the husbandmen, to receive of the fruits of the vineyard.
MAK|12|3||And they beat him, and sent him away empty.
MAK|12|4||And again he sent to them another servant; and him also they stoned, and wounded, and sent him away under indignities.
MAK|12|5||And again he sent another; and him they killed. And he sent many other servants, some of whom they beat, and some they killed.
MAK|12|6||At last, having an only and dear son, he sent him to them; for he said, Perhaps they will respect my son.
MAK|12|7||But those husbandmen said among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
MAK|12|8||And they took him, and slew [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.
MAK|12|9||What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and transfer the vineyard to others.
MAK|12|10||And have ye not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, hath become the head of the corner:
MAK|12|11||From the Lord, was this; and it is wonderful in our eyes?
MAK|12|12||And they sought to apprehend him, but were afraid of the people; for they knew that he spoke this similitude against them. And they left him, and went away.
MAK|12|13||And they sent to him some of the Scribes and of the household of Herod, to ensnare him in discourse.
MAK|12|14||And these came, and asked him: Teacher; we know that thou art veracious, and hast no fear of man; for thou regardest not the face of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give capitation money to Caesar; or not? Shall we give, or not give?
MAK|12|15||And he knew their wile, and said to them: Why tempt ye me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
MAK|12|16||And they brought [one] to him. And he said to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They said to him: Caesar's.
MAK|12|17||Jesus said to them: What is Caesar's, give to Caesar; and what is God's, [give] to God. And they wondered at him.
MAK|12|18||Then came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, and said:
MAK|12|19||Teacher: Moses wrote to us, that if a man's brother die, and leave a widow, but leave no children, his brother shall take his widow, and raise up seed to his brother.
MAK|12|20||There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died, and left no seed.
MAK|12|21||And the second took her, and died, and he also left no seed: and the third in like manner.
MAK|12|22||And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all, the woman also died.
MAK|12|23||In the resurrection, therefore, of which of them will she be the wife? For all the seven took her.
MAK|12|24||Jesus said to them: Is it not on this account that ye err, because ye understand not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
MAK|12|25||For when they rise from the dead, they do not take wives, nor are wives given to husbands; but they are as the angels that are in heaven.
MAK|12|26||But concerning the dead, that they rise, have ye not read in a book of Moses, how God said to him from the bush: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
MAK|12|27||He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Ye, therefore, do err greatly.
MAK|12|28||And one of the Scribes came, and heard them as they discussed, and he saw that he gave them an excellent answer; and he asked him, Which is the first of all the commandments?
MAK|12|29||Jesus said to him: The first of all the commandments [is]: Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord:
MAK|12|30||and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy might. This is the first commandment.
MAK|12|31||And the second, which is like it, [is]: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
MAK|12|32||The Scribe said to him: Excellently! Rabbi; thou hast spoken the truth; for he is one [God], and there is no other beside him.
MAK|12|33||And for a man to love him, with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the soul, and with all the might; and to love his neighbor, as himself; is better than all holocausts and sacrifices.
MAK|12|34||And Jesus perceived that he replied wisely; and he answered, and said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.---And no one dared again to question him.
MAK|12|35||And as Jesus was teaching in the temple, he answered and said: How can the Scribes say, that Messiah is the son of David?
MAK|12|36||For David himself saith, by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord; Seat thyself on my right hand, until I place thy enemies as a footstool beneath thy feet.
MAK|12|37||David therefore calleth him "My Lord;" and how is he his son? And all the multitude heard him with pleasure.
MAK|12|38||And he said to them in his teaching: Beware of the Scribes, who choose to walk in long robes, and love the salutation in the streets,
MAK|12|39||and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief couches at feasts.
MAK|12|40||They devour the houses of widows, under pretence that they prolong their prayers. These shall receive a greater condemnation.
MAK|12|41||And as Jesus sat over against the treasury-room, he saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. And many rich ones cast in much.
MAK|12|42||And a poor widow came, and cast in two mites, which are a brass farthing.
MAK|12|43||And Jesus called his disciples, and said to them: Verily I say to you, That this poor widow hath cast into the treasury more than all they that cast in.
MAK|12|44||For they all cast in of that which abounded to them, but she, of her poverty, hath cast in all that she possessed, the whole of her property.
MAK|13|1||And as Jesus retired from the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Teacher; behold; see these stones, and these structures!
MAK|13|2||And Jesus said to him: Admirest thou these great structures? There will not be left here one stone upon another, not demolished.
MAK|13|3||And as Jesus was sitting on the mount of Olives, over against the temple, Cephas and James and John and Andrew asked him, privately:
MAK|13|4||Tell us, when will these things be? and what [will be] the sign that these things approach their consummation?
MAK|13|5||And Jesus began to say to them Beware, that no one mislead you:
MAK|13|6||for many will come in my name, and will say: I am he. And they will mislead many.
MAK|13|7||But when ye shall hear of battles, and the rumor of battles, be not afraid; for this must be; but the end is not yet.
MAK|13|8||For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be earthquakes in several places, and there will be famines and insurrections. These are the beginning of sorrows.
MAK|13|9||And take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to the tribunals; and ye will be beaten in the synagogues, and ye will stand before kings and governors, on my account, for a testimony to them.
MAK|13|10||And my tidings must first be proclaimed among all the nations.
MAK|13|11||And when they shall lead you to deliver you up, be not solicitous beforehand what ye shall say, neither premeditate; but, that which shall be given you in that hour, speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
MAK|13|12||And brother will deliver up his brother to death, and the father his son; and children will rise up against their parents, and will kill them.
MAK|13|13||And ye will be hated of every man, on account of my name. But whoever shall persevere to the end, shall live.
MAK|13|14||And when ye see the profane sign of desolation, which was mentioned by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not;---(let him that readeth, understand;) then let those that are in Judaea, flee to the mountain:
MAK|13|15||and let him that is on the roof, not come down and enter [it], to take any thing from his house:
MAK|13|16||and let him that is in the field, not return back to take his clothing.
MAK|13|17||But, woe to those with child, and to those who nurse children, in those days!
MAK|13|18||And pray ye, that your flight be not in winter.
MAK|13|19||For in those days will be affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation that God made until now, and shall not be.
MAK|13|20||And, unless God should shorten those days, no flesh would live. But, on account of the elect whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened those days.
MAK|13|21||Then, if any one shall say to you: Lo, here is Messiah, or lo, there; give not credence.
MAK|13|22||For false Messiahs will arise, and lying prophets; and they will give signs and wonders; and will deceive, if possible, even the elect.
MAK|13|23||But take ye heed. Lo, I have told you the whole beforehand.
MAK|13|24||And in those days, after that affliction, the sun will be darkened; and the moon will not give her light;
MAK|13|25||and the stars will fall from heaven; and the powers of heaven will be shaken.
MAK|13|26||And then will they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.
MAK|13|27||And then will he send forth his angels, and will assemble his elect from the four winds, from the extremity of earth to the extremity of heaven.
MAK|13|28||And, from the fig-tree learn ye a simile. When its twigs are tender, and its leaves bud forth, ye know that summer approacheth.
MAK|13|29||So also, when ye shall see these occurrences, know ye, that it is near, at the door.
MAK|13|30||Verily I say to you, That this generation shall not pass away, until all these things occur.
MAK|13|31||Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
MAK|13|32||But of that day and that hour, knoweth no man; nor the angels of heaven; neither the Son, but the Father.
MAK|13|33||Take heed, watch, and pray; for ye know not when the time is.
MAK|13|34||For it is as a man, who took a journey, and left his home; and he gave authority to his servants, and to each his service; and he commanded the porter to be watchful.
MAK|13|35||Watch ye, therefore; for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh; at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:
MAK|13|36||lest he come suddenly, and find you sleeping.
MAK|13|37||And what I say to you, I say to you all: Be ye watchful.
MAK|14|1||And after two days, was the passover of unleavened cakes. And the chief priests and the Scribes sought how they might take him by stratagem, and kill him.
MAK|14|2||But they said: Not on the festival, lest there be commotion among the people.
MAK|14|3||And when he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined, a woman came having an alabaster box of precious ointment of spikenard, of great price; and she opened and poured upon the head of Jesus.
MAK|14|4||And there were certain of the disciples, who were dissatisfied among themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment?
MAK|14|5||For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and been given to the poor. And they were indignant at her.
MAK|14|6||But Jesus said: Let her alone; why trouble ye her? She hath done an excellent act towards me.
MAK|14|7||For the poor ye have always with you; and when ye please, ye can do them kind offices: but I am not always with you.
MAK|14|8||What was in her power, she hath done; and by anticipation, hath perfumed my body, as if for burial.
MAK|14|9||Verily I say to you, That wherever this my gospel shall be proclaimed, in all the world, this also which she hath done shall be told in memory of her.
MAK|14|10||And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, in order to betray Jesus to them.
MAK|14|11||And when they heard [him], they rejoiced; and they promised to give him money. And he sought for opportunity to betray him.
MAK|14|12||And on the first day of unleavened cakes, on which the Jews slay the passover, his disciples said to him: Where wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the passover?
MAK|14|13||And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them: Go ye to the city, and behold, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water. Go ye after him,
MAK|14|14||and where he entereth in, say ye to the lord of the house: Our Rabbi saith, Where is the place of refreshment, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
MAK|14|15||And lo, he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
MAK|14|16||And his disciples went, and entered the city, and found as he had told them: and they made ready the passover.
MAK|14|17||And when it was evening, he came with his twelve.
MAK|14|18||And as they reclined and ate, Jesus said: Verily I say to you, That one of you that eateth with me, will betray me.
MAK|14|19||And they began to be distressed. And they said to him, one by one, Is it I?
MAK|14|20||And he said to them: It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish.
MAK|14|21||And the Son of man goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed. Better would it have been for that man, if he had not been born.
MAK|14|22||And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them, and said to them: Take; this is my body.
MAK|14|23||And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and blessed, and gave to them. And they all drank of it.
MAK|14|24||And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed in behalf of many.
MAK|14|25||Verily I say to you, That I will not drink again of the product of the vine, until the day in which I shall drink it anew in the kingdom of God.
MAK|14|26||And they sang praise, and went out to the mount of Olives.
MAK|14|27||And Jesus said to them: All of you will this night be stumbled in me: for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and his sheep will be scattered."
MAK|14|28||And when I am risen, I will precede you into Galilee.
MAK|14|29||And Cephas said to him: Though they all should be stumbled, yet I will not be.
MAK|14|30||Jesus said to him: Verily I say to thee, That this day, on this night, before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt thrice deny me.
MAK|14|31||And he said, in addition: If I were to die with thee, I will not deny thee, my Lord. And like him, spake all the disciples.
MAK|14|32||And they came to the place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.
MAK|14|33||And he took with him Cephas and James and John, and began to be gloomy and distressed.
MAK|14|34||And he said to them: My soul hath anguish, even to death. Wait for me here, and be watchful.
MAK|14|35||And he advanced a little, and fell upon the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
MAK|14|36||And he said: Father, my Father, thou canst do all things. Let this cup pass from me. Yet not my pleasure, but thine.
MAK|14|37||And he came and found them sleeping. And he said to Cephas: Sleepest thou, Simon? Couldst thou not watch with me one hour?
MAK|14|38||Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit is willing and ready, but the body is weak.
MAK|14|39||And he went again and prayed, speaking the same language.
MAK|14|40||And returning he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And they knew not what to say to him.
MAK|14|41||And he came the third time, and said to them: Sleep on now, and take rest. The end is near; the hour is come; and lo, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
MAK|14|42||Arise ye; let us go. Lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
MAK|14|43||And while he was yet speaking, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, arrived, and much people, with swords and clubs, from before the chief priests and Scribes and Elders.
MAK|14|44||And the traitor who betrayed [him], had given them a sign, and said: He whom I shall kiss is the man. Seize promptly, and lead him away.
MAK|14|45||And immediately he came up, and said to him: Rabbi, Rabbi; and kissed him.
MAK|14|46||And they laid hands on him and took him.
MAK|14|47||And one of them that stood by, drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
MAK|14|48||And Jesus answered and said to them: Have ye come out against me, as against a robber; with swords and clubs, to apprehend me?
MAK|14|49||I was daily with you, while I taught in the temple, and ye seized me not. But this occurs, that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
MAK|14|50||Then his disciples left him and fled.
MAK|14|51||And a young man followed after him, who was clad with a linen cloth on [his] naked [body]: and they laid hold of him.
MAK|14|52||And he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
MAK|14|53||And they led away Jesus to Caiaphas the high priest. And with him were assembled all the chief priests and the Scribes and the Elders.
MAK|14|54||And Simon followed after him, at a distance; into the hall of the high priest; and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself by the fire.
MAK|14|55||And the chief priests and all the assembly sought for testimony against Jesus, to put him to death: but they found it not.
MAK|14|56||For while many testified against him, their testimonies were inadequate.
MAK|14|57||And some false witnesses stood up against him, and said:
MAK|14|58||We have heard him say: I will destroy this temple, which is made with hands; and in three days I will build another not made with hands.
MAK|14|59||Nor even thus were their testimonies adequate.
MAK|14|60||And the high priest arose in the midst, and interrogated Jesus and said: Returnest thou no answer? What do these testify against thee?
MAK|14|61||And Jesus was silent, and made no reply. And again the chief priest interrogated him, and said: Art thou the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed?
MAK|14|62||And Jesus said to him: I am. And ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and he will come on the clouds of heaven.
MAK|14|63||And the high priest rent his tunic, and said: What need of witnesses have we, any more?
MAK|14|64||Behold, from his own mouth ye have heard blasphemy. How doth it appear to you? And they all decided, that he deserved to die.
MAK|14|65||And some began to spit in his face, and to buffet him, saying: Prophesy thou. And the servants smote him on the cheeks.
MAK|14|66||And as Simon was below in the court, a maid of the high priest came,
MAK|14|67||and saw him warming himself; and she looked upon him, and said to him: And thou too wast with Jesus the Nazarean.
MAK|14|68||But he denied, and said: l know not what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
MAK|14|69||And the maid saw him again, and she began to say to those standing by, This man also is one of them.
MAK|14|70||And he again denied [it]. And a little after, those standing there said again to Cephas: Surely, thou art one of them; for thou art likewise a Galilean, and thy speech answers to it.
MAK|14|71||And he began to imprecate, and swore: I know not that man, of whom ye speak.
MAK|14|72||And immediately the cock crew the second time. And Simon remembered the declaration of Jesus, who said to him: Before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.
MAK|15|1||And forthwith, in the morning, the chief priests with the Elders and the Scribes, and the whole Sanhedrim, held a consultation. And they bound Jesus, and led him away, and delivered him over to Pilate the president.
MAK|15|2||And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? He replied and said to him: Thou hast said.
MAK|15|3||And the chief priests accused him of many things.
MAK|15|4||And Pilate again questioned him, and said to him: Makest thou no reply? See how much they testify against thee!
MAK|15|5||But Jesus gave no answer; so that Pilate wondered.
MAK|15|6||And it was his custom, at each festival, to release to them one prisoner, whom they might desire.
MAK|15|7||And there was one named Bar Abas, who was confined with the movers of sedition, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
MAK|15|8||And the people clamored, and began to demand, that he should do to them as he was accustomed.
MAK|15|9||And Pilate answered, and said: Will ye, that I release to you the king of the Jews?
MAK|15|10||For Pilate knew that the chief priests, from envy, had delivered him up.
MAK|15|11||But the chief priests further persuaded the multitudes, that Bar Abas should be released to them.
MAK|15|12||And Pilate said to them: What will ye, therefore, that I do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?
MAK|15|13||And they again cried out: Crucify him.
MAK|15|14||And Pilate said to them: But what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more: Crucify him.
MAK|15|15||And Pilate was willing to gratify the wishes of the multitudes; and he released to them Bar Abas; and, having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to them to be crucified.
MAK|15|16||And the soldiers led him into the hall which was the Praetorium; and they called together the whole regiment;
MAK|15|17||and they clothed him in purple, and braided a crown of thorns and put upon him;
MAK|15|18||and began to salute him with, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
MAK|15|19||And they smote him on the head with a reed and spit in his face, and bowed upon their knees and worshipped him.
MAK|15|20||And having mocked him, they divested him of the purple, and clothed him in his own garments, and led him forth to crucify him.
MAK|15|21||And they compelled a passer-by, Simon the Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was coming from the fields, to bear his cross.
MAK|15|22||And they brought him to Golgotha, the place which is interpreted a Skull.
MAK|15|23||And they gave him to drink wine in which myrrh was mixed; and he would not receive it.
MAK|15|24||And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments; and cast the lot upon them, what each should take.
MAK|15|25||And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
MAK|15|26||And the cause of his death was written in the inscription: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MAK|15|27||And they crucified with him two robbers, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
MAK|15|28||And the scripture was fulfilled which saith: He was accounted among the wicked.
MAK|15|29||And they also that passed by, reviled him; and, nodding their heads, they said: Aha, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days,
MAK|15|30||rescue thyself, and come down from the cross.
MAK|15|31||And so also the chief priests, jeering one with another, and the Scribes, said: He gave life to others, his own life he cannot save.
MAK|15|32||Let Messiah, the king of the Jews, now descend from the cross, that we may see [it] and believe in him. And those also who were crucified with him, derided him.
MAK|15|33||And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
MAK|15|34||And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said: Il, Il, lemono shebakthone; that is: My God, my God; why hast thou forsaken me?
MAK|15|35||And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said: He calleth for Elijah.
MAK|15|36||And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and tied it on a reed, to offer him drink. And they said: Desist; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.
MAK|15|37||And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and expired.
MAK|15|38||And the curtain of the door of the temple was rent, from the top to the bottom.
MAK|15|39||And when the centurion, who was standing near him, saw that he so cried and expired, he said: Verily, this was the Son of God.
MAK|15|40||And there were women looking on, from a distance, Mary Magdalena, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
MAK|15|41||who, when he was in Galilee adhered to him, and ministered to him; and many other women, who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
MAK|15|42||And, as it was the eve of preparation, which precedeth the sabbath,
MAK|15|43||Joseph of Ramath, an honorable counsellor, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God, came, and assuming courage, went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
MAK|15|44||And Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And he called the centurion, and inquired if he had been any time dead.
MAK|15|45||And when he learned it, he gave his body to Joseph.
MAK|15|46||And Joseph bought fine linen, and took it down, and wrapped it in the linen, and deposited it in a sepulchre that was hewed in a rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the sepulchre.
MAK|15|47||And Mary Magdalena and Mary [the mother] of Joses saw where he was laid.
MAK|16|1||And when the sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalena, and Mary [the mother] of James, and Salome, bought aromatics, that they might come and anoint him.
MAK|16|2||And in the morning of the first day of the week, they came to the sepulchre as the sun arose.
MAK|16|3||And they said among themselves: Who will roll back for us the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
MAK|16|4||And they looked, and saw that the stone was rolled away; for it was very great.
MAK|16|5||And entering the sepulchre, they saw a youth sitting on the right hand, and clothed in a white robe: and they were in perturbation.
MAK|16|6||But he said to them: Be not affrighted. Ye are seeking Jesus the Nazarean, who was crucified. He is risen; he is not here. Behold the place where he was laid.
MAK|16|7||But go, tell his disciples and Cephas: Lo, he precedeth you into Galilee; there will ye see him, as he said to you.
MAK|16|8||And when they heard, they fled and left the sepulchre; for astonishment and trembling had seized them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were in fear.
MAK|16|9||And in the morning of the first day of the week, he arose; and he appeared first to Mary Magdalena, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
MAK|16|10||And she went and told them that had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping.
MAK|16|11||And they, when they heard [the women] say that he was alive, and that he had appeared to them, did not believe them.
MAK|16|12||After this he appeared, under another aspect, to two of them as they walked and went into the country.
MAK|16|13||And these went and told the rest; but they would not believe them
MAK|16|14||And at last, he appeared to the eleven: as they reclined at table; and he reproved the slenderness of their faith, and the hardness of their heart; because they believed not those who had seen him actually risen.
MAK|16|15||And he said to them: Go ye into all the world, and proclaim my tidings in the whole creation.
MAK|16|16||He that believeth, and is baptized, liveth; but he that believeth not, is condemned.
MAK|16|17||And these signs shall attend them that believe: In my name, they will cast out demons; and in new tongues will they speak.
MAK|16|18||And they will take up serpents; and if they should drink a deadly poison, it will not harm them; and they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be healed.
MAK|16|19||And Jesus, our Lord, after he had conversed with them, ascended to heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
MAK|16|20||And they went forth, and preached everywhere: and our Lord aided them, and confirmed their discourses by the signs which they wrought.
LUK|1|1||Since many have been disposed to write narratives of those events, of which we have full assurance,
LUK|1|2||as they delivered them to us, who from the first were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word;
LUK|1|3||it seemed proper for me also, as I had examined them all accurately, to write out the whole, methodically, for thee, excellent Theophilus:
LUK|1|4||that thou mayest know the truth of the statements, which thou hast been taught.
LUK|1|5||In the days of Herod the king of Judaea, there was a certain priest, whose name was Zachariah, of the ministration of the house of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
LUK|1|6||And they were both upright before God, and walked in all his commandments, and in the righteousness of the Lord, without reproach.
LUK|1|7||But they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren: and they were both advanced in life.
LUK|1|8||And it occurred, that as he performed the priestly functions in the order of his ministration before the Lord,
LUK|1|9||according to the usage of the priesthood, it fell to him to offer the incense. And he went into the temple of the Lord,
LUK|1|10||and the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
LUK|1|11||And the angel of the Lord appeared to Zachariah, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
LUK|1|12||And when Zachariah saw him, he was agitated, and fear fell upon him.
LUK|1|13||And the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachariah; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth will bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
LUK|1|14||And thou wilt have joy and gladness: and many will rejoice at his birth.
LUK|1|15||For he will be great before the Lord; and he will not drink wine nor strong drink, and will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.
LUK|1|16||And many of the children of Israel will he convert to the Lord their God.
LUK|1|17||And he will go before him, in the spirit and power of Elijah the prophet, and will turn the heart of the fathers unto the children, and them that are disobedient to the knowledge of the righteous, and will prepare a perfect people for the Lord.
LUK|1|18||And Zachariah said to the angel: How shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife is advanced in life.
LUK|1|19||The angel answered, and said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God; and I am sent to converse with thee, and to tell thee these things.
LUK|1|20||Henceforth thou wilt be dumb, and unable to speak, until the day when these things take place: because thou believedst not my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
LUK|1|21||And the people were standing and waiting for Zachariah; and they wondered at his tarrying so long in the temple.
LUK|1|22||And when Zachariah came forth, he could not speak with them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he made many signs to them, and remained speechless.
LUK|1|23||And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he came to his house.
LUK|1|24||And it was after those days, that Elisabeth his wife conceived. And she secluded herself five months; and she said:
LUK|1|25||These things hath the Lord done for me, in the days when he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.
LUK|1|26||And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God into Galilee, to a city named Nazareth,
LUK|1|27||to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
LUK|1|28||And the angel entered the house, and said to her: Peace to thee, thou full of grace! The Lord is with thee: and blessed art thou among women.
LUK|1|29||And when she saw [him], she was agitated by his speech; and she pondered, what this salutation could mean.
LUK|1|30||And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God.
LUK|1|31||For lo, thou wilt conceive in thy womb, and wilt bear a son, and wilt call his name Jesus.
LUK|1|32||He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
LUK|1|33||And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his reign there will be no end.
LUK|1|34||And Mary said to the angel: How can this be, as I have not known a man?
LUK|1|35||The angel replied, and said to her: The Holy Spirit will come, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee; therefore he that is born of thee is holy, and will be called the Son of God.
LUK|1|36||And lo, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, even she too hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren.
LUK|1|37||Because nothing is difficult for God.
LUK|1|38||Mary said: Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me, according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
LUK|1|39||And Mary arose in those days, and went hastily to the mountain [district], to a city of Judaea;
LUK|1|40||and entered the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elisabeth.
LUK|1|41||And it was so, that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the child leaped in her womb, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit.
LUK|1|42||And she cried out with a loud voice, and said to Mary: Blessed art thou among women; and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
LUK|1|43||And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
LUK|1|44||For lo, as the voice of thy salutation fell upon my ears, with great joy the child leaped in my womb.
LUK|1|45||And happy is she that believed; for there will be a fulfillment of those things that were told her by the Lord.
LUK|1|46||And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord:
LUK|1|47||and my spirit rejoiceth in God the author of my life.
LUK|1|48||For he hath looked upon the humble condition of his hand maid; and lo, henceforth all generations will ascribe blessedness to me.
LUK|1|49||And He that is mighty hath done for me great things; and holy is his name.
LUK|1|50||And his mercy is on them that fear him, for generations and posterities.
LUK|1|51||He hath wrought victory with his arm; and hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
LUK|1|52||He hath cast down the mighty from their thrones, and hath exalted the lowly.
LUK|1|53||The hungry hath he satisfied with good things, and the rich hath he sent away empty.
LUK|1|54||He hath aided Israel his servant, and remembered his mercy,
LUK|1|55||(as he spoke with the fathers,) with Abraham and his seed, for ever.
LUK|1|56||And Mary remained with Elisabeth about three months, and returned to her home.
LUK|1|57||And Elisabeth's time of bringing forth arrived; and she bore a son.
LUK|1|58||And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
LUK|1|59||And it occurred, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they called him by the name of his father, Zachariah.
LUK|1|60||And his mother answered and said: Not so; but John, shall he be called.
LUK|1|61||And they said to her: There is no one among thy kindred called by that name.
LUK|1|62||And they made signs to his father, how he would have him named.
LUK|1|63||And he asked for a tablet, and wrote, and said: John is his name. And every one was surprised.
LUK|1|64||And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue; and he spoke, and praised God.
LUK|1|65||And fear came upon all their neighbors; and these things were talked of in all the mountain [district] of Judaea.
LUK|1|66||And all who heard, pondered them in their heart, and said: What will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
LUK|1|67||And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, and said:
LUK|1|68||Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath visited his people, and wrought redemption for them:
LUK|1|69||And hath raised up a horn of redemption for us, in the house of David his servant:
LUK|1|70||as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who were of old,
LUK|1|71||that he would redeem us from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.
LUK|1|72||And he hath exercised his mercy to our fathers, and hath remembered his holy covenants,
LUK|1|73||and the oath that he sware to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,
LUK|1|74||to be redeemed from the hand of our enemies; and that we should worship before him, without fear,
LUK|1|75||all our days, in rectitude and uprightness.
LUK|1|76||And thou, child, wilt be called a prophet of the Most High; for thou wilt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his way,
LUK|1|77||that he may give the knowledge of life to his people, and forgiveness of their sins,
LUK|1|78||through the compassion of the mercy of our God; whereby the day-spring from on high will visit us,
LUK|1|79||to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death; and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
LUK|1|80||And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit. And he was in the wilderness, until the day of his manifestation to Israel.
LUK|2|1||And in those days it occurred, that a decree went forth from Augustus Caesar, that all the people of his dominion should be enrolled.
LUK|2|2||And this enrollment was first made under the presidency of Quirinus in Syria.
LUK|2|3||And everyone went to his own city to be enrolled.
LUK|2|4||And Joseph also went up from Nazareth of Galilee to Judaea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
LUK|2|5||with Mary his espoused, then pregnant, to be enrolled.
LUK|2|6||And it was while they were there, that the days for her to bring forth were completed.
LUK|2|7||And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in bandages, and laid him in the stall; for they had no place where they could lodge.
LUK|2|8||And there were shepherds in that region, who abode there and kept watch of their flocks by night.
LUK|2|9||And lo, the angel of God came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone upon them: and they feared with great fear.
LUK|2|10||And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold I announce to you great joy, which will be to all the world.
LUK|2|11||For there is born to you this day a deliverer, who is the Lord Messiah, in the city of David
LUK|2|12||And this is the sign for you: Ye will find the babe wrapped in bandages, and placed in a stall.
LUK|2|13||And instantly there were seen with the angel, the many hosts of heaven, praising God, and saying:
LUK|2|14||Glory to God in the highest [heavens], and on earth peace and good hope for men.
LUK|2|15||And it was so, that when the angels had gone from them into heaven, the shepherds conferred with one another, and said: Let us go down to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath occurred, as the Lord hath made known to us.
LUK|2|16||And they came hastily, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe laid in the stall.
LUK|2|17||And when they saw, they made known the information which was given to them concerning the child.
LUK|2|18||And all that heard, wondered at the things that were told them by the shepherds.
LUK|2|19||And Mary laid up all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
LUK|2|20||And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all that they had seen and heard, as it was told them.
LUK|2|21||And when the eight days for the circumcision of the child were completed, his name was called JESUS; as he was named by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.
LUK|2|22||And when the days of their purification were completed, according to the law of Moses, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him before the Lord:
LUK|2|23||(as it is written in the law of the Lord, that every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:)
LUK|2|24||and to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.
LUK|2|25||And there was a certain man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon. This man was upright and just, and was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
LUK|2|26||And it had been told him by the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death, until he should see the Messiah of the Lord.
LUK|2|27||This man came, by the Spirit, into the temple; and when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him as is commanded in the law,
LUK|2|28||he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said:
LUK|2|29||My Lord, now release thou thy servant in peace, as thou hast said:
LUK|2|30||for lo, my eyes have seen thy mercy,
LUK|2|31||which thou hast prepared in the presence of all nations,
LUK|2|32||a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for thy people Israel.
LUK|2|33||And Joseph and his mother were astonished at those things which were spoken concerning him.
LUK|2|34||And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold, this [child] is set forth for the fall and for the rising of many in Israel, and for a standard of contention;
LUK|2|35||(and also a dart will pierce thy own soul); that the thoughts of the hearts of many may be disclosed.
LUK|2|36||And Hanna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher,---she also was aged in days, and, from her maidenhood, had lived seven years with her husband,
LUK|2|37||and was a widow of about eighty and four years, and departed not from the temple, but worshipped by day and by night with fasting and prayer;
LUK|2|38||and she too stood up, in that hour, and gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to every one that waited for the redemption of Jerusalem.
LUK|2|39||And when they had accomplished all things, according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their city Nazareth.
LUK|2|40||And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and was filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK|2|41||And his people went up to Jerusalem every year, at the feast of the passover.
LUK|2|42||And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the feast, as they were accustomed.
LUK|2|43||And when the days were completed, they returned: but the child Jesus remained at Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it];
LUK|2|44||for they supposed he was with his companions. And when they had travelled a day's journey, they sought him among their people, and [inquired] of every one that knew them.
LUK|2|45||And they did not find him. And they returned again to Jerusalem, searching for him.
LUK|2|46||And after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, and listening to them, and asking them questions.
LUK|2|47||And all they that heard him, were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.
LUK|2|48||And when they saw him they were amazed. And his mother said to him: My son, why hast thou done so to us? For lo, I and thy father have been seeking for thee with great anxiety.
LUK|2|49||He said to them: Why did ye seek me? Do ye not know, that it behooveth me to be in my Father's house?
LUK|2|50||But they did not comprehend the word that he spoke to them.
LUK|2|51||And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And his mother laid up all these things in her heart.
LUK|2|52||And Jesus increased in stature, and in wisdom, and in grace, before God and men.
LUK|3|1||And in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, in the presidency of Pontius Pilate in Judaea, while Herod was Tetrarch in Galilee, and Philip his brother Tetrarch in Ituraea and in the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene,
LUK|3|2||in the high priesthood of Annas and of Caiaphas; the word of God was upon John the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.
LUK|3|3||And he came into all the region about the Jordan, proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
LUK|3|4||As it is written in the book of the discourses of Isaiah the prophet, who said: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; and make straight paths in the plain for our God.
LUK|3|5||All valleys shall be filled up, and all mountains and hills be lowered; and the hillock shall be levelled down, and the rough place become smooth.
LUK|3|6||And all flesh shall see the life which is of God.
LUK|3|7||And he said to the multitudes, who came to him to be baptized: Ye progeny of vipers, who hath instructed you to flee from the future wrath?
LUK|3|8||Bring forth, therefore, fruits comporting with repentance. And begin not to say in yourselves: We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God can, from these stones, raise up sons to Abraham.
LUK|3|9||And lo, the ax is put to the root of trees. Every tree therefore that beareth not good fruits, is hewed down, and falleth into the fire.
LUK|3|10||And the multitudes asked him, and said: What, then, shall we do?
LUK|3|11||He answered and said to them: Whoever hath two tunics, let him give [one] to him that hath none; and whoever hath food, let him do the same.
LUK|3|12||And publicans also came to be baptized. And they said to him: Teacher, what shall we do?
LUK|3|13||And he said to them: Exact no more than ye are required to exact.
LUK|3|14||And those serving in war inquired of him, and said: And what shall we do? He said to them: Be insolent to no one, and oppress no one, and let your pay satisfy you.
LUK|3|15||And while the people were thinking of John, and all pondered in their heart, whether he were the Messiah;
LUK|3|16||John answered and said to them: Behold, I baptize you with water; but after me cometh one mightier than I, the strings of whose shoes I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
LUK|3|17||He holdeth his winnowing shovel in his hand, and he will make clean his threshing floor; and the wheat he gathereth into his garners, and the chaff he will burn with fire not extinguished.
LUK|3|18||And many other things also, he taught and proclaimed to the people.
LUK|3|19||But Herod the Tetrarch, because he was reproved by John, on account of Herodias the wife of his brother Philip, and on account of all the evil things he had done,
LUK|3|20||added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK|3|21||And it occurred, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized. And as he prayed, the heavens were opened;
LUK|3|22||and the Holy Spirit descended upon him, in the bodily likeness of a dove: and there was a voice from heaven, which said: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I have delight.
LUK|3|23||And Jesus was about thirty years old. And he was accounted the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
LUK|3|24||the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,
LUK|3|25||the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
LUK|3|26||the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Shimei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,
LUK|3|27||the son of Joanna, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zorubbabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri,
LUK|3|28||the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
LUK|3|29||the son of Joses, the son of Eliezer, the son of Joram, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
LUK|3|30||the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
LUK|3|31||the son of Melcah, the son of Mainan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
LUK|3|32||the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon
LUK|3|33||the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Pharez, the son of Judah
LUK|3|34||the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
LUK|3|35||the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Salah,
LUK|3|36||the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
LUK|3|37||the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mehalaleel, the son of Cainan,
LUK|3|38||the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK|4|1||And Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan. And the Spirit led him into the wilderness,
LUK|4|2||forty days, to be tempted by the Calumniator. And during those days, he ate nothing; and when he had completed them, he was at last hungry.
LUK|4|3||And the Calumniator said to him: If thou art the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
LUK|4|4||Jesus replied, and said to him: It is written, Not by bread only, doth man live; but by every thing of God.
LUK|4|5||And Satan conducted him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the land, in a little time.
LUK|4|6||And the Calumniator said to him: To thee will I give all this dominion, and the glory of it, which is committed to me, and to whom I please, I give it:
LUK|4|7||if therefore thou wilt worship before me, the whole shall be thine.
LUK|4|8||But Jesus replied, and said to him: It is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
LUK|4|9||And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him: If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down hence:
LUK|4|10||for it is written, He will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
LUK|4|11||and in their arms will they sustain thee, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone.
LUK|4|12||And Jesus replied and said to him: It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
LUK|4|13||And when the Calumniator had finished all his temptations, he departed from him for a time.
LUK|4|14||And Jesus returned, in the power of the Spirit, to Galilee; and fame concerning him spread in all the region around them.
LUK|4|15||And he taught in their synagogues, and was lauded by every one.
LUK|4|16||And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he went, as he was accustomed, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and rose up to read.
LUK|4|17||And there was delivered to him the book of Isaiah the prophet. And Jesus opened the book, and found the place where it is written:
LUK|4|18||The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; and therefore he hath anointed me to proclaim tidings to the poor; and hath sent me to heal the contrite in heart, and to proclaim release to the captives, and sight to the blind; and to send away the contrite with forgiveness [of their sins];
LUK|4|19||and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
LUK|4|20||And he rolled up the book, and gave it to the servitor, and went and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing upon him.
LUK|4|21||And he began to say to them: This day, is this scripture which ye have heard, fulfilled.
LUK|4|22||And all bare him witness, and admired the gracious words which proceeded from his mouth; and they said: Is not this the son of Joseph?
LUK|4|23||Jesus said to them: Perhaps, ye will speak to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: and whatever we have heard of thy doing in Capernaum, do thou here also in thy city.
LUK|4|24||And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There is no prophet who is acceptable in his own city.
LUK|4|25||And I tell you the truth, that there were many widows in the house of Israel, in the days of Elijah the prophet, when the heavens were closed up three years and six months, and there was a great famine in all the land:
LUK|4|26||but to no one of them was Elijah sent, except to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a widow woman.
LUK|4|27||And there were many leprous in the house of Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet; but none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.
LUK|4|28||And when they heard these things, those in the synagogue were all filled with wrath.
LUK|4|29||And they rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and brought him to the top of the hill on which the city was built, that they might cast him down from the rock.
LUK|4|30||But he passed through the midst of them, and went away.
LUK|4|31||And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee; and taught them on sabbath days.
LUK|4|32||And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was authoritative.
LUK|4|33||And there was in the synagogue a man, in whom was an unclean demon: and he cried out, with a loud voice,
LUK|4|34||and said: Let me alone: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarean? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the Holy One of God.
LUK|4|35||And Jesus rebuked him, and said: Shut thy mouth; and come out of him. And the demon threw him down in the midst, and came out of him, having not harmed him at all.
LUK|4|36||And wonder seized every one, and they talked together, and said: What a word is this! For, with authority and efficiency, he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out
LUK|4|37||And his fame went out into all the surrounding region.
LUK|4|38||And when Jesus went out of the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon. And the mother-in-law of Simon was afflicted with a severe fever: and they besought him in her behalf .
LUK|4|39||And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. And immediately she arose and ministered to them.
LUK|4|40||And when the sun was set, all those that had sick persons, afflicted with divers diseases, brought them to him; and he laid his hand on every one of them, and healed them.
LUK|4|41||And demons went out of many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Messiah, the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and suffered them not to say, that they knew him to be Messiah.
LUK|4|42||And at the dawn of day, he went out and retired to a desert place. And the multitudes sought him, and went out to him, and held him fast, that he might not retire from them.
LUK|4|43||And Jesus said to them: It behooveth me to announce the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore was I sent.
LUK|4|44||And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK|5|1||And it occurred, that a multitude gathered about him, to hear the word of God. And he was standing by the side of the sea of Gennesaret,
LUK|5|2||and he saw two ships standing near the sea, and the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
LUK|5|3||And one of them belonged to Simon Cephas: and Jesus entered and sat in it. And he told them to draw off a little from the shore, into the sea: and he seated himself, and taught the multitude from the ship.
LUK|5|4||And when he ceased from speaking, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and cast your net for a draught.
LUK|5|5||Simon answered, and said to him: Rabbi, all the night we have toiled, and have caught nothing: but, at thy bidding, I will cast the net.
LUK|5|6||And when they had done so, they inclosed very many fishes, so that the net was rent.
LUK|5|7||And they made signs to their associates, in the other ship, to come and help them. And when they came, they filled both the ships, so that they were near to sinking.
LUK|5|8||And when Simon Cephas saw [it], he fell before the feet of Jesus, and said to him: I beseech thee, my Lord, that thou leave me, for I am a sinful man.
LUK|5|9||For astonishment had seized him, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had caught:
LUK|5|10||and in like manner also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. But Jesus said: Fear thou not; henceforth thou shalt catch men unto life.
LUK|5|11||And they brought the vessels to the land: and they left all and followed him.
LUK|5|12||And when Jesus was in one of the cities, a man came all full of leprosy and seeing Jesus, he fell upon his face, and besought him, and said to him: My Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
LUK|5|13||And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him: I will [it]; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy went from him.
LUK|5|14||And he charged him: Speak to no one; but go and show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy purification, as Moses hath commanded, for a testimony to them.
LUK|5|15||And his fame spread abroad still more: and much people assembled to hear him, and to be cured of their diseases.
LUK|5|16||And he retired into a desert, and prayed.
LUK|5|17||And it occurred, on one of the days when Jesus was teaching, that Pharisees and Doctors of the law were sitting by, who had come from all the villages of Galilee and of Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
LUK|5|18||And some persons brought a paralytic man, on a couch, and sought to bring him in, and to place him before him.
LUK|5|19||And when they could not thus introduce him, because of the multitude of the people, they ascended to the roof, and let him down with the couch, from the covering, into the midst, before Jesus.
LUK|5|20||And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
LUK|5|21||And the Scribes and Pharisees began to reason, and to say: Who is this that speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgive sins, but God only?
LUK|5|22||And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: What think ye in your heart?
LUK|5|23||Which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?
LUK|5|24||But that ye may know, that the Son of man is competent to forgive sins on the earth,---he said to the paralytic: I say to thee, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy home.
LUK|5|25||And instantly, he rose up before their eyes, and took up his couch, and went home, glorifying God.
LUK|5|26||And astonishment seized every one; and they Praised God; and they were filled with awe, and said: We have seen wonders today.
LUK|5|27||And after these things, Jesus went out and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting among the publicans; and he said to him: Come after me.
LUK|5|28||And he left every thing, and arose, and went after him.
LUK|5|29||And Levi made a great entertainment for him at his house; and there was a numerous company of publicans and others who reclined with them.
LUK|5|30||And the Scribes and Pharisees murmured, and said to his disciples: Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
LUK|5|31||And Jesus answered and said to them: A physician is not sought after for the well, but for those very sick.
LUK|5|32||I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
LUK|5|33||And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and pray, and also [those] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
LUK|5|34||And he said to them: Ye cannot make the guests of the nuptial chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them.
LUK|5|35||But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken up from them, and then will they fast, in those days.
LUK|5|36||And he spoke a similitude to them: No one teareth a patch from a new garment, and putteth it to an old garment; lest he tear the new, and the patch from the new cease to make the old [garment] whole.
LUK|5|37||And no one putteth new wine into old sacks; otherwise, the new wine will burst the sacks, and the wine will run out, and the sacks be ruined.
LUK|5|38||But they put new wine into new sacks, and both are preserved.
LUK|5|39||And no one drinketh old wine, and immediately calleth for new; for he saith, The old is the delicious.
LUK|6|1||And on a sabbath it occurred, as Jesus walked among the tilled grounds, that his disciples plucked ears, and rubbed them in their hands and ate.
LUK|6|2||And some of the Pharisees said to them: Why do ye that, which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath?
LUK|6|3||Jesus replied, and said to them: Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, he and those with him?
LUK|6|4||How he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the bread of the Lord's table, and gave [it] to those that were with him; which it was not lawful, except for the priests only, to eat?
LUK|6|5||And he said to them: The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
LUK|6|6||And on another sabbath, he entered a synagogue and taught. And a man was there, whose right hand was withered.
LUK|6|7||And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might be able to accuse him.
LUK|6|8||And as he knew their thoughts, he said to the man with a withered hand: Rise and come into the midst of the congregation. And when he came and stood [there],
LUK|6|9||Jesus said to them: I ask you, What is it lawful to do on the sabbath? that which is good? or that which is evil? to save life or to destroy [it]?
LUK|6|10||And he looked upon them all; and [then] said to him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched out his hand, and it was restored like the other.
LUK|6|11||And they were filled with envy; and they conferred one with another, what they should do to Jesus.
LUK|6|12||And in those days, Jesus retired to a mountain to pray; and he passed the night there, in prayer to God.
LUK|6|13||And when the day dawned, he called his disciples, and selected from them twelve, whom he named Legates :
LUK|6|14||Simon whom he named Cephas, and Andrew his brother, and James, and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew,
LUK|6|15||and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who was called Zelotes,
LUK|6|16||and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
LUK|6|17||And Jesus descended with them, and stood in the plain; and a great company of his disciples, and a multitude of assembled people, from all Judaea, and from Jerusalem and from the seashore of Tyre and Sidon; who came to hear his discourse, and to be healed of their diseases;
LUK|6|18||and they who were afflicted by unclean spirits: and they were healed.
LUK|6|19||And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for there went a virtue out of him and healed them all.
LUK|6|20||And he lifted his eyes upon his disciples, and said: Blessed are ye poor; for the kingdom of God is yours.
LUK|6|21||Blessed are ye that hunger now; for ye will be satisfied. Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye will laugh.
LUK|6|22||Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and repel you, and revile you, and cast out your names as base, for the Son of man's sake.
LUK|6|23||Rejoice in that day and exult, for your reward is great in heaven; for so did their fathers to the prophets.
LUK|6|24||But, woe to you that are rich; for ye have received your consolation.
LUK|6|25||Woe to you that are full; for ye will hunger. Woe to you that laugh now, for ye will weep and mourn.
LUK|6|26||Woe to you, when men shall speak your praise; for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
LUK|6|27||And to you who hear, I say: Love your enemies; and do favors to them that hate you;
LUK|6|28||and bless them that curse you; and pray for them that drag you with violence.
LUK|6|29||To him that smiteth thee on thy cheek, offer the other: and from him that taketh away thy cloak, keep not back thy tunic.
LUK|6|30||To every one that asketh of thee, give thou: and from him that taketh thy property, demand it not.
LUK|6|31||And as ye would that men should do to you, so do ye also to them.
LUK|6|32||For, if ye love them that love you, what goodness is it in you? For even sinners love those that love them.
LUK|6|33||And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what goodness is it in you? For even sinners do the same.
LUK|6|34||And if ye lend to one from whom ye expect recompense, what goodness is it in you? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive adequate recompense.
LUK|6|35||But love ye your enemies, and do them good; and lend ye, and disappoint the hopes of no one: and great will be your reward, and ye will be children of the Highest; for he is kind to the evil, and to the unthankful.
LUK|6|36||Be ye therefore merciful, as also your Father is merciful.
LUK|6|37||Judge not, and ye will not be judged: condemn not, and ye will not be condemned: release, and ye will be released.
LUK|6|38||Give ye, and it will be given to you; in good measure, pressed down, and running over, will they cast into your lap. For, with what measure ye measure, it will be measured to you.
LUK|6|39||And he spake a similitude to them: Can a blind man lead a blind? Will not both fall into the ditch?
LUK|6|40||No disciple is better than his teacher; for whoever is perfect, will be like his teacher.
LUK|6|41||And why observest thou the straw that is in thy brother's eye, but regardest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
LUK|6|42||Or how canst thou say to thy brothers, My brother, allow me to pluck the straw from thy eye; when, lo, the beam that is in thy own eye, thou regardest not. Hypocrite! first cast the beam out thy eye, and then thy vision will be clear to pluck the straw from thy brother's eye.
LUK|6|43||There is no good tree, that beareth bad fruits; nor a bad tree, that beareth good fruits.
LUK|6|44||For every tree is known by its fruits. Do men gather figs from thorn-bushes? So, neither do they pluck grapes from brambles.
LUK|6|45||A good man, from the good treasure that is in his heart, bringeth out good things: and a bad man, from the bad treasure that is in his heart, bringeth out bad things. For, from the abundance of the heart, the lips speak.
LUK|6|46||And why call ye me, My Lord, my Lord; while ye do not that which I command you?
LUK|6|47||Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show to whom he is like:
LUK|6|48||He is like a man that built a house; and he dug and went deep, and laid the foundations on a rock: and when a flood occurred, the flood rushed upon that house, and could not move it, for its foundation rested on a rock.
LUK|6|49||But he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built his house upon the earth, without a foundation; and when the torrent rushed upon it, it fell immediately, and the ruin of that house was great.
LUK|7|1||And when he had finished all these discourses in the audience of the people, Jesus entered into Capernaum.
LUK|7|2||And the servant of a centurion, who was dear to him, was very sick, and near to death.
LUK|7|3||And he heard of Jesus, and sent the Elders of the Jews to him, and requested of him that he would come and save the life of his servant.
LUK|7|4||And when they came to Jesus, they entreated him earnestly, and said: He is worthy that thou shouldst do this for him;
LUK|7|5||for he loveth our nation, and hath also built us a house of assembly.
LUK|7|6||And Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent his friends to him, and said to him: My Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof:
LUK|7|7||therefore I deemed myself not worthy to approach thee myself; but speak the word only, and my young man will be healed.
LUK|7|8||For I also am a man subjected to authority; and I have soldiers under my command; and I say to this one, Go; and he goeth: and to another, Come; and he cometh: and to my servant, Do this; and he doeth [it.]
LUK|7|9||And when Jesus heard these things, he admired him; and he turned, and said to the throng that followed him: I say to you, I have not found faith like this even in Israel.
LUK|7|10||And they that were sent, returned to the house; and they found the servant that had been sick, now well.
LUK|7|11||And the following day, he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples [were] with him, and a great multitude.
LUK|7|12||And as he approached the gate of the city, he saw a procession bearing a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she a widow; and a great company of the people of the city were with her.
LUK|7|13||And Jesus looked upon her, and had compassion on her; and he said to her, Weep not.
LUK|7|14||And he went, and touched the bier; and they that bore him stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, Arise.
LUK|7|15||And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.
LUK|7|16||And awe seized all the people; and they glorified God, and said: A great prophet hath arisen among us, and God hath visited his people.
LUK|7|17||And that saying respecting him went out through all Judaea and all the surrounding region.
LUK|7|18||And the disciples of John told him all these things.
LUK|7|19||And John called two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, and said: Art thou he that cometh, or shall we look for another?
LUK|7|20||And they came to Jesus, and said to him: John the Baptizer hath sent us to thee, and saith: Art thou he that cometh, or shall we look for another?
LUK|7|21||And in that hour he healed many persons of their diseases, and of plagues, and of unclean spirits, and gave sight to many blind persons.
LUK|7|22||And Jesus replied, and said to them: Go ye, and tell John all that ye have seen and heard; that the blind see, and the lame walk, and the leprous are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead arise, and to the poor good news is proclaimed:
LUK|7|23||and blessed is he that is not stumbled in me.
LUK|7|24||And when John's disciples were gone, Jesus began to say to the multitude, concerning John: What went ye into the wilderness to see?---a reed agitated by the wind?
LUK|7|25||Or if not; what went ye out to see?---a man clad in soft raiment? Lo, they that use splendid garments and luxuries, are in kings' palaces.
LUK|7|26||Or if not; what went ye out to see?---a prophet? Yea, say I to you; and more than a prophet.
LUK|7|27||[For] this is he, of whom it is written: Behold I send my messenger before thy face, to prepare thy way before thee.
LUK|7|28||I say to you, that no prophet, among those born of women, was greater than John the Baptizer: and yet the little one in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.
LUK|7|29||And all the people that heard him, justified God, as they had been baptized with John's baptism.
LUK|7|30||But the Pharisees and Scribes rejected the good pleasure of God, against themselves; as they were not baptized by him.
LUK|7|31||To what, therefore, shall I compare this generation? and to what are they like?
LUK|7|32||They are like children, that sit in the market-place, and call to their fellows and say: We have piped to you, and ye did not dance; we have howled to you, and ye did not weep.
LUK|7|33||For John the Baptizer came, not eating bread, and not drinking wine; and ye say: He hath a demon.
LUK|7|34||The Son of man came, eating and drinking; and ye say: Behold, a gluttonous man, and a wine drinker, and one fond of publicans and sinners.
LUK|7|35||But wisdom is justified by all her children.
LUK|7|36||And one of the Pharisees came, and asked him to eat with him. And he entered the house of the Pharisee, and reclined.
LUK|7|37||And there was a woman in the city, who was a sinner; and when she learned that he reclined in the Pharisee's house, she took an alabaster box of perfume,
LUK|7|38||and stood behind him, at his feet, and wept; and she began to bathe his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head; and she kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the perfume.
LUK|7|39||And when the Pharisee that invited him, saw it, he thought within himself, and said: If this man were a prophet, he would know who she is, and what is her reputation; for the woman that toucheth him, is a sinner.
LUK|7|40||And Jesus answered, and said to him: Simon, I have something to say to thee. He said to him: Say it, Rabbi. Jesus said to him:
LUK|7|41||There were two debtors to a certain creditor; the one owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty denarii.
LUK|7|42||And as they had not the means of pay, he released them both. Which of them, therefore will love him most?
LUK|7|43||Simon replied, and said: I suppose he to whom most was released. Jesus said to him: Thou hast judged correctly.
LUK|7|44||And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon: Seest thou this woman? I entered thy house, and thou gavest [me] no water for my feet; but she hath bathed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
LUK|7|45||Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
LUK|7|46||Thou didst not anoint my head with perfume; but she hath anointed my feet with perfumed ointment.
LUK|7|47||I therefore say to thee: Her many sins are forgiven her, for she loveth much. But he, to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.
LUK|7|48||And he said to the woman: Thy sins are forgiven thee.
LUK|7|49||And they that were reclining, began to say in themselves: Who is this, that even forgiveth sins?
LUK|7|50||And Jesus said to the woman: Thy faith hath given thee life. Go, in peace.
LUK|8|1||And after these things Jesus travelled about the cities and the villages, and proclaimed and announced the kingdom of God. And with him were his twelve [disciples],
LUK|8|2||and those women who were healed of infirmities and of unclean spirits, Mary called Magdalena, out of whom went seven demons,
LUK|8|3||and Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to them of their property.
LUK|8|4||And when a great multitude was assembled, and people came to him from all the cities, he said, in similitudes:
LUK|8|5||A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the side of the path, and was trodden upon, and a bird devoured it.
LUK|8|6||And other fell upon a rock, and sprung up forthwith; but, as it lacked moisture, it dried up.
LUK|8|7||And other fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up with it, and choked it.
LUK|8|8||And other fell on good and fair ground, and sprung up, and bore fruits, a hundred for one. Having said these things, he cried: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK|8|9||And his disciples asked him: what meaneth this similitude?
LUK|8|10||And he said to them: To you it is given, to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to others, it is spoken in allegories; that, while seeing, they may not see, and while hearing, may not understand.
LUK|8|11||But this is the similitude: The seed is the word of God.
LUK|8|12||And those by the side of the path, are they that hear the word, and the enemy cometh and taketh the word out of their heart, that they may not believe and live.
LUK|8|13||And those upon the rock, are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy: but they have no root in them, and their faith is temporary, and in time of temptation they are stumbled.
LUK|8|14||And that which fell among thorns, are those who hear the word, but are choked by cares, and by riches, and by worldly desires, and bear no fruits.
LUK|8|15||And that on good ground, are those who, with a humble and good heart, hear the word, and retain it, and with patience bring forth fruits.
LUK|8|16||No one lighteth a lamp, and covereth it with a vessel, or placeth it under a bed, but setteth it upon a light-stand, that all who come in, may see the light of it.
LUK|8|17||For there is nothing covered, that shall not be uncovered; nor concealed, that shall not be known and become manifest.
LUK|8|18||Take heed how ye hear: for to him that hath, shall be given; and from him that hath not, shall be taken even what he thinketh he hath.
LUK|8|19||And his mother and his brothers came to him, and they could not speak with him, because of the multitude.
LUK|8|20||And they say to him: Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, and wish to see thee.
LUK|8|21||And he answered and said: My mother and my brothers, are they who hear the word of God, and do it.
LUK|8|22||And on a certain day Jesus embarked and sat in a ship, he and his disciples. And he said to them; Let us pass over to the other side of the sea.
LUK|8|23||And while they were rowing, Jesus fell asleep. And there was a tempest of wind on the sea; and the ship was near to sinking.
LUK|8|24||And they came and awaked him, and said to him: Our Rabbi, our Rabbi, we are perishing! And he arose, and rebuked the winds and the agitations of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.
LUK|8|25||And he said to them: Where is your faith? And they being in awe, wondered, and said one to another: Who is this, that commandeth even the winds, and the waves, and the sea; and they obey him?
LUK|8|26||And they rowed on, and came to the country of the Gadarenes, which lieth over against Galilee.
LUK|8|27||And when he went out upon the land, there, met him a man of the city, in whom had been a demon for a long time; and he wore no clothing, and did not reside in a house, but among the tombs.
LUK|8|28||And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said, with a loud voice: What have we to do with thee? Jesus, thou Son of the exalted God. I entreat of thee, torment me not.
LUK|8|29||For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit, to come out of the man: for, of a long time he had been held captive by him; and he had been bound with chains, and held in fetters; but he had burst the bonds, and had been driven by the demon into the desert.
LUK|8|30||And Jesus demanded of him: What is thy name? And he said to him: Legion: because many demons had entered into him.
LUK|8|31||And they besought him, not to command them to depart into the abyss.
LUK|8|32||And there was a herd of many swine grazing on the mountain. And they besought him, that he would permit them to enter the swine. And he permitted them.
LUK|8|33||And the demons went out of the man, and entered the swine; and the whole herd ran to a precipice, and plunged into the sea, and were strangled.
LUK|8|34||And when the herdmen saw what had occurred, they fled, and told [it] in the cities and the villages.
LUK|8|35||And the men went out to see what was done. And they came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had gone, now clothed, and modest, and sitting at the feet of Jesus; and they were awed.
LUK|8|36||And they that saw [it], related to them in what manner the demoniac was cured.
LUK|8|37||And the whole throng of the Gadarenes requested him, that he would depart from them: for great fear had seized them. And Jesus embarked in a ship, and retired from among them.
LUK|8|38||And the man, from whom the demons had gone out, requested that he might remain with him. But Jesus dismissed him, and said to him:
LUK|8|39||Return to thy home, and relate what God hath done for thee. And he went away, and proclaimed through all the city what Jesus had done for him.
LUK|8|40||And when Jesus returned, a great multitude received him; for all were looking for him.
LUK|8|41||And a man, whose name was Jairus, a chief of the synagogue, fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him to enter his house;
LUK|8|42||for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was near dying. And as Jesus went with him, a great multitude pressed upon him.
LUK|8|43||And a certain woman, whose blood had flowed twelve years, and who had expended all her property among physicians, and could not be cured by any one,
LUK|8|44||came up behind him, and touched the border of his garment; and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
LUK|8|45||And Jesus said: Who touched me? And when all denied, Simon Cephas and those with him said to him: Our Rabbi, crowds press upon thee and sayest thou, Who touched me?
LUK|8|46||And he said: Some one touched me; for I perceive, that energy hath gone out from me.
LUK|8|47||And the woman, when she saw that she had not escaped his notice, came trembling, and fell down and worshipped him. And in the presence of all the people, she declared for what cause she had touched him, and that she was instantly healed.
LUK|8|48||And Jesus said to her: Take courage, my daughter: Thy faith hath given thee life: Go in peace.
LUK|8|49||And while he was speaking, one came from the house of the chief of the synagogue, and said to him: Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the teacher.
LUK|8|50||And Jesus heard [it], and said to the father of the maid: Fear not; believe only, and she will live.
LUK|8|51||And Jesus came to the house; and he suffered none to go in with him, except Simon, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the maid.
LUK|8|52||And all were weeping and wailing over her. And Jesus said: Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth
LUK|8|53||And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
LUK|8|54||And he put every one out, and took her by the hand, and called, and said: Maid, arise.
LUK|8|55||And her spirit returned, and she instantly arose. And he directed them to give her food.
LUK|8|56||And her parents were astonished: and he charged them to tell no one what had occurred.
LUK|9|1||And Jesus called his twelve, and gave them power and authority over all demons and diseases, to heal [them].
LUK|9|2||And he sent them forth, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
LUK|9|3||And he said to them: Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff, nor a wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two tunics.
LUK|9|4||And into whatever house ye enter, there stay, and thence depart.
LUK|9|5||And against them that receive you not, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet against them, for a testimony.
LUK|9|6||And the Legates went forth, and travelled about the villages and cities, and preached and healed everywhere.
LUK|9|7||And Herod the Tetrarch heard of all the things done by him, and he was disturbed; because some said, that John had arisen from the dead.
LUK|9|8||But others said, that Elijah hath appeared; and others, that a prophet from among the ancient prophets hath arisen.
LUK|9|9||And Herod said: The head of John, I have cut off; but who is this, of whom I hear these things? And he was desirous to see him.
LUK|9|10||And when the Legates returned, they narrated, to Jesus all they had done. And he took them aside, to the desert part of Bethsaida.
LUK|9|11||And when the multitude knew [it], they followed him: and he received them, and conversed with them respecting the kingdom of God: and such as had need of healing, he healed.
LUK|9|12||And when the day began to decline, his disciples came near, and said to him: Send away the multitude, that they may go to the villages around us and to the towns, to lodge in them, and to procure themselves food, for we are in a desert place.
LUK|9|13||Jesus said to then: Give ye them to eat. And they say: We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless we go and buy food for all this people:
LUK|9|14||for they were about five thousand men. Jesus said to them: Make them recline by companies, fifty persons in a company.
LUK|9|15||And the disciples did so, and made them all recline.
LUK|9|16||And Jesus took the five loaves and two fishes, and looked towards heaven, and blessed, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before the multitudes.
LUK|9|17||And they all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the fragments of remains, twelve baskets.
LUK|9|18||And as he was praying in private with his disciples, he asked them, and said: Who, do the multitudes say of me, that I am?
LUK|9|19||They answer and say to him: John the Baptizer; others, Elijah and others, a prophet, one of the ancient prophets arisen.
LUK|9|20||He said to them: But who, do ye say, that I am? Simon answered, and said: The Messiah of God.
LUK|9|21||And he chided them, and charged them, that they should say this to no one.
LUK|9|22||And he said to them: The Son of man is to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the Elders and the chief priests and Scribes; and they will kill him; and on the third day, he will arise.
LUK|9|23||And he said before all the people: He that would follow me, must deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and [so] come after me.
LUK|9|24||For he that will preserve his life, shall lose it; but he that shall lose his life, for my sake, will preserve it.
LUK|9|25||For, what will a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his life or be deprived [of it]?
LUK|9|26||And whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels.
LUK|9|27||I tell you the truth, that there are some standing here, who will not taste death, until they shall see the kingdom of God.
LUK|9|28||And it was about eight days after these discourses, that Jesus took Simon and James and John, and went up a mountain to pray.
LUK|9|29||And while he prayed, the aspect of his countenance was changed, and his garments became white and brilliant.
LUK|9|30||And lo, two men were talking with him: and they were Moses and Elijah,
LUK|9|31||who appeared in glory. And they were conversing on his departure, which was to be consummated at Jerusalem.
LUK|9|32||And Simon and those with him were oppressed with drowsiness; and being scarcely awake, they saw his glory, and those two men who stood near him.
LUK|9|33||And when they began to retire from him, Simon said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is delightful for us to be here. And let us make here three booths, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. But he knew not what he said.
LUK|9|34||And as he thus spoke, there was a cloud; and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they saw Moses and Elijah go up into the cloud.
LUK|9|35||And there was a voice from the cloud, which said: This is my beloved Son; hear ye him.
LUK|9|36||And when the voice had passed, Jesus was found to be alone.---And they kept silence, and told no one in those days what they had seen.
LUK|9|37||And the next day, as they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met them.
LUK|9|38||And a man from the throng cried out, and said: Teacher, I beseech thee, turn thyself to me. Here is my only son:
LUK|9|39||and a spirit cometh upon him, and he suddenly crieth out, and gnasheth his teeth, and foameth; and he hardly leaveth him, when he hath crushed him.
LUK|9|40||And I requested thy disciples to expel him; and they could not.
LUK|9|41||And Jesus answered, and said: O the unbelieving and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring hither thy son.
LUK|9|42||And while he was bringing him, the demon threw him down, and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the lad, and delivered him to his father.
LUK|9|43||And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.---And while every one admired at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples:
LUK|9|44||Lay up these words in your minds: for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.
LUK|9|45||But they understood not that speech; because it was hidden from them, that they should not know it: and they feared to ask him concerning that speech.
LUK|9|46||And the thought arose among them, which of them [was to be] the greatest.
LUK|9|47||And Jesus knew the thought of their heart: and he took a child, and placed him near to him;
LUK|9|48||and said to them: Whoever receiveth a child like this, in my name, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. For he that shall be least among you all, he will be the great one.
LUK|9|49||And John answered, and said: Our Rabbi, we saw a man casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he doth not, with us, follow thee.
LUK|9|50||Jesus said to them: Forbid not: for, whoever is not against you, is for you.
LUK|9|51||And when the days for his ascension were completed, so it was, that he set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
LUK|9|52||And he sent messengers before his face; and they went, and entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare [lodgings] for him.
LUK|9|53||And they received him not, because he had set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
LUK|9|54||And when his disciples James and John saw [it], they said to him: Our Lord, wilt thou that we speak, and fire come down from heaven, and consume them, as also did Elijah?
LUK|9|55||And he turned and rebuked them, and said: Ye know not of what spirit ye are.
LUK|9|56||For the Son of man hath not come to destroy souls; but to quicken [them]. And they went to another village.
LUK|9|57||And as they went by the way, one said to him: I will follow thee to whatever place thou goest, my Lord.
LUK|9|58||Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have coverts; but the Son of man hath not where he may lay his head.
LUK|9|59||And he said to another: Come thou after me. And he said to him: My Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
LUK|9|60||And Jesus said to him: Allow the dead to bury their dead; and go thou and proclaim the kingdom of God.
LUK|9|61||Another said to him: I will follow thee, my Lord; but allow me first to bid adieu to my household, and I will come.
LUK|9|62||Jesus said to him: No man putting his hand to the ox-plough, and looking backward, is fit for the kingdom of God.
LUK|10|1||And after these things, Jesus separated from among his disciples seventy other persons, and sent them, two and two, before his face, to every place and city whither he was to go.
LUK|10|2||And he said to them: The harvest is great, and the laborers few: pray ye, therefore, the lord of the harvest that he would send laborers into his harvest.
LUK|10|3||Go ye: lo, I send you forth, as sheep among wolves.
LUK|10|4||Take to you no purses, nor wallets, nor shoes; and salute no man by the way.
LUK|10|5||And into whatever house ye enter, first say: Peace be to this house.
LUK|10|6||And if the son of peace is there, your salutation will rest upon it; but if not, your salutation will return to you.
LUK|10|7||And remain in that house, eating and drinking of what it affords; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. And pass not from house to house.
LUK|10|8||And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you; eat that which set before you.
LUK|10|9||And heal them that are sick in it; and say to them: The kingdom of God hath come near you.
LUK|10|10||And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not; go out into the street, and say:
LUK|10|11||Even the dust of your city which adhereth to our feet, we shake off against you: but this know ye, that the kingdom of God hath come near to you.
LUK|10|12||I say to you, that for Sodom there will be comfort in that day, rather than for that city.
LUK|10|13||Woe to thee, Chorazin; woe to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon there had been the mighty deeds, that were in you, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.
LUK|10|14||But for Tyre and Sidon there will be comfort in the day of judgment, rather than for you.
LUK|10|15||And thou Capernaum, that art lifted up to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell.
LUK|10|16||He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.
LUK|10|17||And the seventy whom he sent forth, returned with great joy, and say to him: Our Lord, even the demons were subject to us, in thy name.
LUK|10|18||And he said to them: I saw Satan fall, like the lightning from heaven.
LUK|10|19||Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents, and scorpions, and on all the power of the adversary: and nothing shall harm you.
LUK|10|20||Yet rejoice not in this, that the demons are subject to you; but rejoice, that your names are written in heaven.
LUK|10|21||In that hour Jesus exulted in the Holy Spirit, and said: I thank thee, my Father, thou Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: yes, my Father, for such was thy good pleasure.
LUK|10|22||And he turned himself to his disciples, and said to them: Every thing is committed to me by my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; or who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal [him].
LUK|10|23||And he turned to his disciples, privately, and said: Blessed are the eyes that see, what ye see.
LUK|10|24||For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see what ye see, and did not see [it]; and to hear what ye hear, and did not hear [it].
LUK|10|25||And behold, a Scribe stood up to try him, and said: Teacher, what must I do, to inherit eternal life?
LUK|10|26||And Jesus said to him: How is it written in the law? How readest thou?
LUK|10|27||He answered and said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor, as thyself.
LUK|10|28||Jesus said to him: Thou hast said correctly; do thus, and thou wilt live.
LUK|10|29||And he, being disposed to justify himself, said: And who is my neighbor?
LUK|10|30||Jesus said to him: A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and robbers fell upon him, and plundered him, and smote him, and left him with little life in him, and went their way.
LUK|10|31||And a certain priest went down by that way; and he saw him, and passed on.
LUK|10|32||So also a Levite came, approached the spot, and saw him, and passed on.
LUK|10|33||But a Samaritan, as he travelled, came where he was, and saw him, and took pity on him,
LUK|10|34||and went to him, and bound up his wounds, and poured wine and oil on them, and placed him upon his ass, and brought him to the inn, and took care of him.
LUK|10|35||And on the morning of the [next] day, he took out two denarii and gave to the host, and said: Take good care of him; and if thou expendest any more, when I return, I will repay thee.
LUK|10|36||Which therefore of these three, appears to thee, to have been neighbor to him that fell into the hands of marauders?
LUK|10|37||And he said: He that had pity on him. Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou also the like.
LUK|10|38||And it occurred, as they travelled by the way, that he entered a certain village, and a woman whose name was Martha, received him at her house.
LUK|10|39||And she had a sister whose name, was Mary: and she came and seated herself at the feet of our Lord, and listened to his discourses.
LUK|10|40||But Martha was occupied with much service; and she came, and said to him: My Lord, hast thou no concern, that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her assist me.
LUK|10|41||Jesus answered, and said to her: Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:
LUK|10|42||yet but one thing is necessary; and Mary hath chosen for herself the good part, which shall not be taken from her.
LUK|11|1||And as he was praying in a certain place, it occurred, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Our Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
LUK|11|2||Jesus said to them: When ye pray, thus speak ye: Our Father who art in heaven, hallow be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy pleasure be done, as in heaven, so on earth;
LUK|11|3||give us daily the bread we need;
LUK|11|4||and remit to us our sins, for we also remit to all that are indebted to us; and bring us not into trials, but deliver us from evil.
LUK|11|5||And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, that shall come to him at midnight and say to him, My friend, lend me three cakes;
LUK|11|6||for a friend hath come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him?
LUK|11|7||And his friend within shall answer, and say to him: Do not disturb me, for lo, the door is closed, and my children with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
LUK|11|8||I say to you: If he give him not, on account of friendship, yet on account of [his] importunity, he will arise and give [him] as much as he asketh.
LUK|11|9||I say also to you: Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and ye will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
LUK|11|10||For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it is opened.
LUK|11|11||For which of you being a father, if his son shall ask him for bread, will he reach to him a stone? Or, if he ask of him a fish, will he, instead of a fish, reach to him a serpent?
LUK|11|12||Or, if he ask of him an egg, will he reach to him a scorpion?
LUK|11|13||And if ye, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
LUK|11|14||And as he was casting out a demon that was dumb, it occurred, that when the demon had gone out, the dumb [man] conversed: and the multitudes admired.
LUK|11|15||But some of them said: It is by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that he casteth out demons.
LUK|11|16||And others, to tempt him, asked of him a sign from heaven.
LUK|11|17||But Jesus, as he knew their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom that is divided against itself, will become a desolation: and a house that is divided against itself, will fall.
LUK|11|18||And if Satan be divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? since ye say, that I by Beelzebub cast out demons.
LUK|11|19||And if I, by Beelzebub, cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast [them] out? Therefore will they be to you judges.
LUK|11|20||But if I, by the finger of God, cast out demons, the kingdom of God hath come near to you.
LUK|11|21||When a strong man armed keepeth his doorway, his property rests securely.
LUK|11|22||But if a stronger than he come and overpower him, he taketh away all his arms on which he relied, and divideth the spoil of him.
LUK|11|23||He that is not for me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, actually scattereth.
LUK|11|24||An unclean spirit, when he goeth out of a man, goeth wandering in places where no water is, in order to find rest; and, as he cannot find [it] he saith: I will return to my habitation, from which I came.
LUK|11|25||And when he cometh, he findeth it swept clean and set in order.
LUK|11|26||Then he goeth and taketh seven other spirits, worse than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
LUK|11|27||And while he was saying these things, a certain woman from the crowd, lifted up her voice, and said to him: Blessed is the womb that carried thee, and the breasts that nursed thee.
LUK|11|28||He said to her: Blessed are they who hear the word of God, and keep it.
LUK|11|29||And when multitudes were assembled, he began to say: This evil generation seeketh a sign; and no sign will be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
LUK|11|30||For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of man be a sign to this generation.
LUK|11|31||The queen of the south will stand up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the other side of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and lo, one superior to Solomon is here.
LUK|11|32||The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and lo, one superior to Jonah is here.
LUK|11|33||No one lighteth a lamp, and putteth it in a secret place, or under a bushel, but upon a light-stand; that they who come in, may see its light.
LUK|11|34||The lamp of thy body is thy eye. Therefore, when thy eye is sound, thy whole body will be enlightened; but if it be bad, thy body also will be dark.
LUK|11|35||See to it, therefore, lest the light that is in thee, be darkness.
LUK|11|36||For if thy whole body be enlightened, and no part in it be dark, the whole will be luminous, as if a lamp enlightened thee by its radiance.
LUK|11|37||And while he was speaking, a certain Pharisee requested him to dine with him: and he went in, and reclined.
LUK|11|38||And the Pharisee noticing him, wondered that he did not previously baptize before dinner.
LUK|11|39||And Jesus said to him: Now ye Pharisees make clean the exterior of the cup and the dish; but your interior is full of extortion and wickedness.
LUK|11|40||Ye deficient in understanding! did not he who made the exterior, make also the interior?
LUK|11|41||But, give ye alms from what ye possess; and lo, every thing will be clean to you.
LUK|11|42||But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue, and every pot-herb; but pass over justice and the love of God. Now ye ought to do these things, and not to omit those.
LUK|11|43||Woe to you, Pharisees! who love the chief seats in the synagogues, and a salutation in the streets.
LUK|11|44||Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like graves that are unknown, and men walk over them and do not know [it].
LUK|11|45||And one of the Scribes replied, and said to him: Teacher, while saying these things, thou reproachest us also.
LUK|11|46||And he said: Woe to you also! ye Scribes, who lade men with heavy burdens; yet ye yourselves will not touch those burdens with one of your fingers.
LUK|11|47||Woe to you! who build the sepulchres of the prophets, whom your fathers slew.
LUK|11|48||Thus ye testify, that ye acquiesce in the deeds of your fathers; for they slew them, and ye build their sepulchres.
LUK|11|49||Therefore hath wisdom said: Lo, I will send to them prophets and legates; and some of them they will persecute and slay;
LUK|11|50||that from this generation may be required, the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed since the world was created;
LUK|11|51||from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zachariah who was slain between the temple and the altar. Yea, say I to you: It will be required of this generation.
LUK|11|52||Woe to you, Scribes; for ye have taken away the keys of knowledge: ye yourselves enter not, and them that are entering ye hinder.
LUK|11|53||And when he had said these things to them, the Scribes and Pharisees began to be offended, and became angry, and carped at his discourses,
LUK|11|54||and practised many wiles upon him, seeking to catch some thing from his lips, that they might accuse him.
LUK|12|1||And when great multitudes were assembled by myriads, so that they trod one upon another, Jesus began to say to his disciples: First of all, beware for yourselves of that leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
LUK|12|2||For there is nothing hidden, which will not be revealed; nor concealed, that will not be known.
LUK|12|3||For whatever ye speak in the dark, will be heard in the light; and what in secret chambers, ye whisper in the ear, will be proclaimed on the house-tops.
LUK|12|4||And to you, my friends, I say: Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and afterwards have nothing more they can do.
LUK|12|5||But I will show you, of whom to be afraid: of him who, after he hath killed, hath authority to cast into hell. Yea, say I to you: be afraid of him.
LUK|12|6||Are not five sparrows sold for two assarii? and not one of them is forgotten before God.
LUK|12|7||And as for you, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; for ye are superior to many sparrows.
LUK|12|8||And I say to you, that every one that shall confess me before men, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.
LUK|12|9||But he that shall deny me before men, shall himself be denied before the angels of God.
LUK|12|10||And every one that shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall reproach the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him.
LUK|12|11||And when they shall bring you into the synagogues, before chiefs and men in authority, be not anxious how ye shall make defence, or what ye shall say;
LUK|12|12||for the Holy Spirit will, in that hour, instruct you what to say.
LUK|12|13||And one of the assembly said to him: Teacher, tell my brother, to divide the inheritance with me.
LUK|12|14||But Jesus said to him: Man, who established me a judge and distributor over you?
LUK|12|15||And he said to his disciples: Beware of all avarice, for life consisteth not in abundance of riches.
LUK|12|16||And he spoke to them a similitude: The land of a certain rich man brought forth produce in abundance.
LUK|12|17||And he considered with himself, and said: What shall I do; for I have not where I can store up my produce?
LUK|12|18||And he said : This will I do; I will pull down my storehouses, and build them larger; and there will I store up all my corn and my good things:
LUK|12|19||and I will say to my soul: My soul, thou hast good things in abundance, which are stored up for many years; take thy ease; eat, drink, and live in pleasure.
LUK|12|20||But God said to him: Thou void of reason! This night, thy soul will be required of thee; and to whom will belong these things provided by thee?
LUK|12|21||Such is he that layeth up treasures for himself, and is not rich in God.
LUK|12|22||And he said to his disciples: Therefore I tell you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor for your body, what ye shall put on.
LUK|12|23||For the life is more important than food, and the body than raiment.
LUK|12|24||Consider the ravens, which sow not, nor reap, nor have cellars and storehouses; yet God provideth them food. How much more important now are ye, than the birds!
LUK|12|25||And which of you, by taking pains, can add one cubit to his stature?
LUK|12|26||And if ye are impotent for that which is least, why are ye anxious about the rest?
LUK|12|27||Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, nor do they spin. Yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory, was clothed like one of these.
LUK|12|28||And if God so clothe the herb, which to-day exists in the field, and to-morrow falls into the oven, how much more you, ye little in faith?
LUK|12|29||And inquire not, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor let your mind wander upon these things.
LUK|12|30||For all these things the people of the world seek after; and your father knoweth that, for you also, these things are needful.
LUK|12|31||But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you.
LUK|12|32||Fear not, little flock; for your Father is disposed to give you the kingdom.
LUK|12|33||Sell your property, and give alms: make for yourselves bags that do not become old, and a treasure that is not transient, in the heavens; where no thief approacheth, and no moth eateth.
LUK|12|34||For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.
LUK|12|35||Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning.
LUK|12|36||And be ye like persons who are waiting for their lord, when he shall return from the house of feasting, that, when he shall come and knock, they may open to him immediately.
LUK|12|37||Happy are those servants, whom their lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say to you: He will gird his loins, and make them recline, and will pass around and serve them.
LUK|12|38||And if in the second watch, or in the third, he shall come and so find [them], happy are those servants.
LUK|12|39||And this know ye, that if the lord of the house had known at what watch the thief would come, he would have been awake and would not have suffered his house to be broken into.
LUK|12|40||Therefore be ye also ready; for at an hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
LUK|12|41||Simon Cephas saith to him: Our Lord, speakest thou this similitude to us, or also to all men?
LUK|12|42||Jesus said to him: Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will place over all his domestics, to give them their portion in due time?
LUK|12|43||Happy is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.
LUK|12|44||Verily I say to you: He will place him over all his possessions.
LUK|12|45||But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite the servants and the maidens of his lord; and shall begin to eat and to drink and be drunk;
LUK|12|46||the lord of that servant will come in a day he thinketh not, and in an hour he knoweth not, and will cut him in two; and will assign him his portion with them that are unfaithful.
LUK|12|47||And the servant that knew his lord's pleasure, and did not prepare for him according to his pleasure, shall be beaten with many [stripes].
LUK|12|48||But he that knew not, yet did that which deserved stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, from him will much be required; and to whom much is committed, the more will be required at his hand.
LUK|12|49||I have come to cast fire on the earth; and I would, that it already burned.
LUK|12|50||And I have a baptism to be baptized with; and I am much pressed until it be accomplished.
LUK|12|51||Suppose ye, that I have come to produce tranquillity on the earth? I tell you, No: but division.
LUK|12|52||For from this time, there will be five [persons] in one house, who will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
LUK|12|53||For a father will be divided against his son, and a son against his father; a mother against her daughter, and a daughter against her mother; a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
LUK|12|54||And he said to the multitudes: When you see a cloud rising out of the west, ye at once say: Rain is coming; and it is so.
LUK|12|55||And when a south wind bloweth, ye say: It will be hot: and it is so.
LUK|12|56||Ye hypocrites, ye know how to distinguish the aspect of the heavens and the earth; and why can ye not distinguish the present time?
LUK|12|57||And why do ye not, of yourselves, judge correctly?
LUK|12|58||And when thou goest with thy adversary to the ruler, while on the way, make effort to be released by him; lest he bring thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the exactor, and the exactor cast thee into prison.
LUK|12|59||For verily I say to thee: Thou wilt not come out thence, until thou pay the last mite.
LUK|13|1||And at that time, some came and told him of those Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
LUK|13|2||And Jesus replied, and said to them: Suppose ye, that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans, because this occurred to them?
LUK|13|3||No. And I say to you, That all of you also, unless ye repent, will likewise perish.
LUK|13|4||Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, suppose ye, that they were sinners beyond all the men inhabiting Jerusalem?
LUK|13|5||No. And I say to you, That except ye repent, ye like them will all of you perish.
LUK|13|6||And he spoke this similitude: A man had a fig-tree that was planted in his vineyard: and he came, seeking fruits upon it, and found none.
LUK|13|7||And he said to the cultivator: Lo, these three years, I have come seeking fruits on this fig-tree, and I find none. Cut it down: why should it cumber the ground?
LUK|13|8||The cultivator said to him: My Lord, spare it this year also, until I shall work about it, and manure it.
LUK|13|9||And if it bear fruits, [well;] and if not, thou wilt cut it down: why should it live?
LUK|13|10||And when Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, on the sabbath,
LUK|13|11||a woman was there who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent over, and could not straighten herself at all.
LUK|13|12||And Jesus saw her, and called her, and said to her: Woman, thou art released from thy infirmity.
LUK|13|13||And he put his hand upon her; and immediately she straightened her self up, and glorified God.
LUK|13|14||And the chief of the synagogue, being angry that Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered, and said to the multitude: There are six days, on which it is lawful to work; on them come ye, and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
LUK|13|15||But Jesus replied, and said to him: Thou hypocrite! Doth not every one of you, on the sabbath, loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him to water?
LUK|13|16||And this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom the Calumniator hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
LUK|13|17||And when he had said these things, all those that stood up against him were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced in all the miracles that were wrought by his hand.
LUK|13|18||And Jesus said: To what is the kingdom of God like? and with what shall I compare it?
LUK|13|19||It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a large tree; and a bird of heaven made her nest in its branches.
LUK|13|20||Jesus said again: With what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
LUK|13|21||It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three seahs of meal, until the whole was fermented.
LUK|13|22||And he travelled through the villages and cities, teaching and going towards Jerusalem.
LUK|13|23||And a person asked him, whether they were few who would have life?
LUK|13|24||And Jesus said to them: Strive to enter the narrow gate: for I say to you, many will seek to enter, and will not be able.
LUK|13|25||From the time that the lord of the house shall rise and close the door, then ye will stand without, and knock at the door; and ye will begin to say: Our Lord, our Lord, open to us and he will answer, and say: I tell you, I know you not, whence ye are.
LUK|13|26||And ye will begin to say: We have eaten and drunken before thee; and thou hast taught in our streets.
LUK|13|27||And he will say to you: I know you not, whence ye are: depart from me, ye doers of falsehood.
LUK|13|28||There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye will see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God; and yourselves will be thrust out.
LUK|13|29||And they will come from the east and from the west, and from the south and from the north, and will recline in the kingdom of God.
LUK|13|30||And lo, there are last that will be first, and there are first that will be last.
LUK|13|31||On the same day came some of the Pharisees, and said to him: Go, depart hence; for Herod purposeth to kill thee.
LUK|13|32||Jesus said to them: Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures, to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I shall be consummated.
LUK|13|33||But I must labor to-day and to-morrow, and on the following day I will go; because it cannot be, that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.
LUK|13|34||O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how many times would I have gathered thy children, as a hen that gathereth her young under her wings, and ye would not?
LUK|13|35||Behold, your house is left to you desolate. For I say to you: Ye will not see me, until ye will say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
LUK|14|1||And it occurred, that, as he entered the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread, on the sabbath day, they watched him.
LUK|14|2||And lo, a dropsical man was before him.
LUK|14|3||And Jesus answered, and said to the Scribes and Pharisees: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?
LUK|14|4||And they were silent. And he took him, and healed him, and dismissed him.
LUK|14|5||And he said to them: Which of you, if his son or his ox fall into a pit on the sabbath day, doth not immediately lift and draw him out?
LUK|14|6||And they could give him no answer to that.
LUK|14|7||And he spoke a similitude to the guests that were present, as he noticed how they chose places on the highest couches.
LUK|14|8||When thou art invited by any one to a house of feasting, go not and recline on the highest couch; lest there should be invited there, one more honorable than thou;
LUK|14|9||and he that invited both him and thee come and say to thee, Give place to this man; and thou be ashamed, when thou risest, and takest a lower couch.
LUK|14|10||But when thou art invited, go and recline on the lowest [couch]; that when he who invited thee come, he may say to thee: My friend, come up higher and recline. And thou wilt have honor, before all that recline with thee.
LUK|14|11||For, every one that exalteth himself, will be humbled: and every one that humbleth himself, will be exalted.
LUK|14|12||And he said to him that invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy relatives, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also invite thee, and thou have this recompense.
LUK|14|13||But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.
LUK|14|14||And thou wilt be blessed. For they cannot recompense thee; but thy recompense will be at the resurrection of the just.
LUK|14|15||And when one of those reclining heard these things, he said to him: Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
LUK|14|16||Jesus said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.
LUK|14|17||And at the time for supper, he sent his servant to say to those invited: Lo, every thing is ready for you; come.
LUK|14|18||And they all to a man, began to excuse themselves. The first said to him: I have bought a field, and am constrained to go out and see it. I pray thee, allow me to be excused.
LUK|14|19||Another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to inspect them. I pray thee, allow me to be excused.
LUK|14|20||Another said: I have married a wife, and on this account I cannot come.
LUK|14|21||And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the lord of the house was angry: and he said to his servant, Go out quickly into the market-places and streets of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the diseased, and the lame, and the blind.
LUK|14|22||And the servant said: My lord, it is done as thou commandedst; and still there is room.
LUK|14|23||And the lord said to his servant: Go out to the by-paths, and among the hedges, and constrain them to come in; that my house may be filled.
LUK|14|24||For I declare to you, that not one of those men that were invited, shall taste of my supper.
LUK|14|25||And when great multitudes were travelling with him, he turned himself, and said to them:
LUK|14|26||He that cometh to me, and hateth not his father and his mother, and his brothers and his sisters, and his wife and his children, and his own life also, cannot become a disciple to me.
LUK|14|27||And he that doth not take up his cross and come after me, cannot become a disciple to me.
LUK|14|28||For, which of you, wishing to build a tower, doth not first sit down and compute the expense, whether he have the means to complete it?
LUK|14|29||lest, when he hath laid the foundation, and is unable to finish, all that see it begin to deride him;
LUK|14|30||and say: This man began to build, and was unable to finish.
LUK|14|31||Or what king, that is going to contend in battle with his neighbor king, doth not first consider, whether he is able, with ten thousand, to meet him that is coming against him with twenty thousand?
LUK|14|32||and if not; while he is yet far from him, he sendeth envoys, and sueth for peace.
LUK|14|33||So every one of you who doth not give up all his possessions, cannot be my disciple.
LUK|14|34||Salt is a good thing: but if the salt itself hath become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted?
LUK|14|35||It is fit for neither the earth, nor the dunghill. They cast it away.---He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK|15|1||And publicans and sinners came to him, to hear him.
LUK|15|2||And the Scribes and Pharisees murmured, and said: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
LUK|15|3||And Jesus spoke to them this similitude:
LUK|15|4||What man among you, that hath a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the desert, and go and seek for that which is lost, until he find it?
LUK|15|5||And when he findeth it, he rejoiceth, and taketh it upon his shoulders;
LUK|15|6||and he cometh home, and he calleth together his friends and neighbors, and saith to them: Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep that was lost.
LUK|15|7||I say to you, that there will thus be joy in heaven, over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just ones, to whom repentance was not necessary.
LUK|15|8||Or what woman is there, who, if she have ten drachmas, and lose one of them, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search for it carefully, until she find it?
LUK|15|9||And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, and saith to them: Rejoice with me, for I have found my drachma that was lost.
LUK|15|10||I say to you, That there will thus be joy, before the angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth.
LUK|15|11||And Jesus said to them again: A certain man had two sons.
LUK|15|12||And his younger son said to him: My father, give me the portion that falleth to me from thy house. And he divided to them his property.
LUK|15|13||And after a few days, the younger son collected together all that fell to him, and went to a distant place and there squandered his property, by living in dissipation.
LUK|15|14||And when he had consumed all that he had, there occurred a great famine in that place; and he began to be in want.
LUK|15|15||And he went and connected himself with one of the citizens of that place: and he sent him into the field to tend swine.
LUK|15|16||And he longed to fill his belly with those pods which the swine ate: and no one gave to him.
LUK|15|17||And when he came to himself, he said: How many hired servants are now at my father's house, who have bread enough, and I am here perishing with hunger.
LUK|15|18||I will arise and go to my father, and say to him: My father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee;
LUK|15|19||and am no longer worthy to be called thy son. Make me like one of thy hired servants.
LUK|15|20||And he arose and went towards his father. And he was yet at a distance, when his father saw him; and he pitied him, and ran, and fell upon his neck and kissed him.
LUK|15|21||And his son said to him: My father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am not worthy to be called thy son.
LUK|15|22||But his father said to his servants: Bring forth the best robe, and clothe him, and put a ring on his hand, and supply him with shoes.
LUK|15|23||And bring forth and slay the fatted bullock; and let us eat, and be merry.
LUK|15|24||For, this my son was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
LUK|15|25||But his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard the sound of the singing of many.
LUK|15|26||And he called to one of the boys, and asked him what it meant.
LUK|15|27||And he said to him: Thy brother hath come; and thy father hath killed the fatted bullock, because he hath received him in health.
LUK|15|28||And he was angry, and would not go in: and his father went out and entreated him.
LUK|15|29||And he said to his father: Lo, these many years have I labored in thy service, and never transgressed thy command; and thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.
LUK|15|30||But for this thy son, when he had dissipated thy property with harlots, and came [home], thou hast slain the fatted bullock for him.
LUK|15|31||His father said to him: My son, thou hast been ever with me, and all that I have, is thine.
LUK|15|32||But it was proper for us to be merry, and to rejoice; because this thy brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.
LUK|16|1||And he spoke a parable to his disciples. There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and accusations were brought to him of him, that he squandered his property.
LUK|16|2||And his lord called him, and said to him: What is this that I hear of thee? Render to me an account of thy stewardship; for thou canst no longer be my steward.
LUK|16|3||And the steward said with himself: What shall I do, since my lord is about to take from me the stewardship? To dig, I am unable; and to become a beggar, I am ashamed.
LUK|16|4||I know what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses.
LUK|16|5||And he called each one of his lord's debtors; and he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?
LUK|16|6||And he said to him, One hundred measures of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write Fifty measures.
LUK|16|7||And he said to another: And how much owest thou to my lord? And he said to him, One hundred cors of wheat. And he said to him: Take thy bill, and sit down, and write Eighty cors.
LUK|16|8||And our Lord praised the unrighteous steward, for having acted sagaciously: for the children of this world are more sagacious than the children of light, in this their generation.
LUK|16|9||And I also say to you: Make to yourselves friends, with this unrighteous mammon; so that when it is finished, they may receive you to their everlasting tabernacles.
LUK|16|10||He that is faithful in the little, is also faithful in the much; and he that is unjust in the little, is also unjust in the much.
LUK|16|11||If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust to you the reality?
LUK|16|12||And if ye have not been found faithful in that which is not yours, who will give to you that which is yours?
LUK|16|13||There is no servant, who can serve two lords. For, either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will honor the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
LUK|16|14||And the Pharisees, when they heard all these things, because they loved money, derided him.
LUK|16|15||And Jesus said to them: Ye are such as justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your heart: for that which is exalted among men, is abominable before God.
LUK|16|16||The law and the prophets were until John: since then, the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and every one presseth it to enter in.
LUK|16|17||And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one letter to pass from the law.
LUK|16|18||Whoever putteth away his wife, and taketh another, committeth adultery; and whoever taketh her that is put away, committeth adultery.
LUK|16|19||And there was a certain rich man, who was clothed in fine linen and scarlet, and passed every day in splendid luxury.
LUK|16|20||And there was a certain poor man, whose name was Lazarus; and he was laid at the gate of the rich man, smitten with ulcers.
LUK|16|21||And he desired to fill his belly with the fragments that fell from the rich man's table: and the dogs also came and licked his ulcers.
LUK|16|22||And so it was, that the poor man died; and angels transported him to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.
LUK|16|23||And being tormented in hell, he raised his eyes from afar off, and saw Abraham, and Lazarus in his bosom.
LUK|16|24||And he called with a loud voice, and said: Abraham, my father, have pity on me; and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and moisten my tongue; for, lo, I am tormented in this flame.
LUK|16|25||And Abraham said to him: My son, remember, that thou receivedst thy good things in thy lifetime, and Lazarus his evil things: and now, behold he is here at rest, and thou art tormented.
LUK|16|26||And with all these, there is a great barrier between us and you; so that they who would pass from here to you, cannot; neither [can they] pass from there to us
LUK|16|27||He said to him: I pray thee, therefore, my father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house;
LUK|16|28||for I have five brothers; that he may go and protest to them; lest they also come to this place of torment.
LUK|16|29||Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.
LUK|16|30||But he said to him: No, my father Abraham: but if one shall go to them from the dead, they will repent.
LUK|16|31||Abraham said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not believe, though one should rise from the dead.
LUK|17|1||And Jesus said to his disciples: It cannot be, but that offences will come: but woe to him, by whom they come.
LUK|17|2||Better for him were it, if a millstone were suspended to his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
LUK|17|3||Take heed to yourselves.---If thy brother transgress, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
LUK|17|4||And if he shall offend against thee seven times in a day, and, seven times in a day, shall turn himself to thee, and say, I repent; forgive him.
LUK|17|5||And the Legates said to our Lord: Increase our faith.
LUK|17|6||He said to them: If ye had faith like a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this mulberry-tree, Be thou torn up by the roots, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
LUK|17|7||Which of you, having a servant driving a yoke of oxen, or tending sheep, will say to him when he cometh from the field, Pass on at once, and recline for supper?
LUK|17|8||But he will say to him: Prepare for me what I may sup upon, and gird thy loins and serve me, until I have eaten and drunken; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink.
LUK|17|9||Hath he thanks for him, because the servant did what was commanded him? I think not.
LUK|17|10||So also ye, when ye have done all the things commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants, for we have done only what we were obligated to do.
LUK|17|11||And it occurred as Jesus advanced towards Jerusalem, that he passed among the Samaritans into Galilee.
LUK|17|12||And when he drew near to enter a certain village, there met him ten leprous men; and they stood at a distance,
LUK|17|13||and raised their voice, and said: Our Rabbi, Jesus, have compassion upon us.
LUK|17|14||And when he had looked upon them, he said to them: Go, show yourselves to the priests. And as they were going, they were cleansed.
LUK|17|15||And one of them, when he saw that he was cleansed, returned, and with a loud voice, glorified God.
LUK|17|16||And he fell on his face, at the feet of Jesus, and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan.
LUK|17|17||And Jesus answered, and said: Were they not ten who were cleansed? Where are the nine?
LUK|17|18||Have they so gone as not to come and give glory to God; except this one, who is of another nation?
LUK|17|19||And he said to him; Arise, and go: thy faith hath given thee life.
LUK|17|20||And as [some] of the Pharisees asked him, When the kingdom of God would come; he answered, and said to them: The kingdom of God will not come with observables.
LUK|17|21||And they will not say: Behold, here it is! or, Behold, it is there! For lo, the kingdom of God is within you
LUK|17|22||And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when ye will long to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye will not see [them].
LUK|17|23||And if they shall say to you: Lo, here he is! or, Lo, there he is! go not forth.
LUK|17|24||For, as the lightning darteth from the heavens, and illuminateth all beneath the heavens; so will the Son of man be, in his day.
LUK|17|25||But, previously, he is to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation.
LUK|17|26||And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of man.
LUK|17|27||They ate and drank, they took wives and were given to husbands, until the day that Noah entered the ark; and the flood came, and destroyed every one.
LUK|17|28||And again, as it was in the days of Lot; they ate and drank, bought and sold, planted and built.
LUK|17|29||But in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, the Lord rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed them all.
LUK|17|30||Thus will it be, in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.
LUK|17|31||In that day, let him that is on the house-top, and his goods in the house, not come down to take them: and let him that is in the field, not return [after what is] behind him.
LUK|17|32||Remember Lot's wife.
LUK|17|33||He that desireth to preserve his life, will lose it; and he that will lose his life, shall preserve it.
LUK|17|34||I tell you, that, in that night, two will be in one bed; one will be taken, and the other left.
LUK|17|35||And two females will be grinding together; one will be taken, and the other left.
LUK|17|36||Two men will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left.
LUK|17|37||They answered, and said to him: Whither, our Lord? He said to them: Where the body is, there will the eagles assemble themselves.
LUK|18|1||And he spoke to them a similitude also, that men should pray at all times, and not become weary.
LUK|18|2||There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, and regarded not men.
LUK|18|3||And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, and said: Vindicate me against my adversary.
LUK|18|4||And he would not, for a long time: but afterwards, he said to himself: Though I fear not God, and regard not men,
LUK|18|5||yet, because this widow troubleth me, I will vindicate her; that she may not be always coming and troubling me.
LUK|18|6||And our Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.
LUK|18|7||And will not God, much more, vindicate his chosen, who call upon him by day and by night; and have patience with them?
LUK|18|8||I tell you, He will vindicate them speedily. Yet the Son of man will come; and will he find faith on the earth?
LUK|18|9||And he spake this similitude, against certain persons, who had confidence in themselves that they were righteous, and despised every one.
LUK|18|10||Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
LUK|18|11||And the Pharisee stood by himself, and prayed thus: God, I thank thee that I have not been like the rest of men, rapacious, oppressive, and adulterous; nor like this publican.
LUK|18|12||But I fast twice in a week, and tithe all I possess.
LUK|18|13||And the publican stood afar off, and would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, and said: God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
LUK|18|14||I say to you, that this [man] went down to his house justified, rather than the Pharisee. For every one that exalteth himself, will be humbled; and every one that humbleth himself, will be exalted.
LUK|18|15||And they brought to him infants, that he might touch them: and his disciples saw them, and rebuked them.
LUK|18|16||But Jesus called them, and said to them: Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of those that are like them, of such is the kingdom of heaven.
LUK|18|17||Verily I say to you, That he who shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, will not enter it.
LUK|18|18||And one of the chiefs asked him, and said to him: Good Teacher, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?
LUK|18|19||Jesus said to him: Why callest thou me, good? For, there is none good, except one; God.
LUK|18|20||Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill; and thou shalt not commit adultery; and thou shalt not steal; and thou shalt not testify a false testimony; honor thy father and thy mother.
LUK|18|21||He said to him: All these have I kept, from my childhood.
LUK|18|22||And when Jesus heard these [words], he said to him: One thing is lacking to thee: go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor; and thou wilt have a treasure in heaven; and come after me.
LUK|18|23||And he, when he heard these [words], was dejected; for he was very rich.
LUK|18|24||And when Jesus saw that he was dejected, he said: How difficult [it is], for those that have wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!
LUK|18|25||It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle, than a rich man the kingdom of God.
LUK|18|26||They who heard [it], said to him: Who then can have life?
LUK|18|27||And Jesus said: Those things which, with men, cannot be, with God, can be.
LUK|18|28||Simon Cephas said to him: Lo, we have left every thing, and come after thee.
LUK|18|29||Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you: There is no man, who hath left houses, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
LUK|18|30||that shall not receive manifold in the present time, and, in the coming world, eternal life.
LUK|18|31||And Jesus took his twelve, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and all the things written in the prophets, concerning the Son of man, will be fulfilled.
LUK|18|32||For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles; and they will mock him, and spit in his face;
LUK|18|33||and will scourge him, and will treat him with ignominy, and will kill him; and, the third day, he will arise.
LUK|18|34||But not one of these things, did they understand; but this subject was hidden from them, and they knew not the things told to them.
LUK|18|35||And as they came near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the side of the way, begging.
LUK|18|36||And he heard the noise of the multitude that passed, and inquired what it was.
LUK|18|37||They say to him: Jesus the Nazarean is passing by.
LUK|18|38||And he called out, and said: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK|18|39||And they that went before Jesus rebuked him, that he might be silent. But he cried out the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK|18|40||And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be called to him. And when he came to him, he asked him,
LUK|18|41||and said to him: What wilt thou, that I do for thee? And he said: My Lord, that I may see.
LUK|18|42||And Jesus said to him: See thou; thy faith hath vivified thee.
LUK|18|43||And immediately he saw. And he followed after him, and glorified God. And all the people who beheld, gave glory to God.
LUK|19|1||And as Jesus entered and passed through Jericho,
LUK|19|2||[there was] a certain man, whose name was Zaccheus, who was rich, and chief of the publicans;
LUK|19|3||and he wished to see Jesus, who he was; and could not, on account of the crowd; because Zaccheus was small in stature.
LUK|19|4||And he ran forward of Jesus, and climbed a wild fig-tree, in order to see him; for he was to pass that way.
LUK|19|5||And when Jesus came to the place, he saw him, and said to him: Make haste and come down, Zaccheus; for I must be at thy house to-day.
LUK|19|6||And he hastened, and came down, and received him with gladness.
LUK|19|7||And when they all saw [it], they murmured, and said: He hath gone in to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
LUK|19|8||And Zaccheus stood up, and said to Jesus: Behold, my Lord, the half of my riches I give to the poor; and to every man, whom I have wronged in any thing, I restore fourfold.
LUK|19|9||Jesus said to him: This day, life is to this house; for he also is a son of Abraham.
LUK|19|10||For the Son of man came, to seek and to vivify that which was lost.
LUK|19|11||And when they heard these things, he proceeded to utter a similitude; because he was near to Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was to be soon developed.
LUK|19|12||And he said: A certain man of high birth was going to a distant place, to obtain royalty, and return again.
LUK|19|13||And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds: and he said to them, Traffic until I come.
LUK|19|14||But the inhabitants of his city hated him; and they sent envoys after him, saying: We wish this man not to reign over us.
LUK|19|15||And when he had obtained the royalty, and had returned, he commanded those servants to be called, to whom he had committed his money; that he might know what each of them had gained by trading.
LUK|19|16||And the first came, and said: My Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
LUK|19|17||He said to him: Well done, good servant! As thou hast been faithful over a little, thou shalt have authority over ten towns.
LUK|19|18||And the second came, and said: My lord, thy pound hath produced five pounds.
LUK|19|19||He said likewise to him: Thou also shalt have authority over five towns.
LUK|19|20||And another came, and said: My lord, lo, this is thy pound, which hath been with me, laid up in fine linen.
LUK|19|21||For I was afraid of thee, because thou art a hard man, and takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou sowedst not.
LUK|19|22||He said to him: Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou evil servant. Thou knewest me, that I am a hard man, and that I take up what I laid not down, and reap what I sowed not!
LUK|19|23||Why didst thou not put my money into the broker's hands, that when I came, I might have demanded it with interest?
LUK|19|24||And he said to them that stood before him: Take from him the pound, and give it to him with whom are the ten pounds.
LUK|19|25||They say to him: Our lord, there are with him ten pounds.
LUK|19|26||He said to them: I tell you, that to every one that hath, will be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath will be taken away.
LUK|19|27||But as for those my enemies, who would not have me to reign over them, bring them and slay them before me.
LUK|19|28||And when Jesus had spoken these things, he went forward, to go to Jerusalem.
LUK|19|29||And when he arrived at Bethphage and Bethany, near to the mount called the place of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
LUK|19|30||and said to them: Go ye to the village that is over against us, and as ye enter [it], ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever rode; loose [him] and bring [him].
LUK|19|31||And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? say to him: Our Lord needeth him.
LUK|19|32||And they went who were sent, and they found, as he said to them.
LUK|19|33||And as they loosed the colt, the owner of him said to them: Why do ye loose that colt?
LUK|19|34||And they said: Because our Lord needeth him.
LUK|19|35||And they brought him to Jesus. And they cast their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus upon him.
LUK|19|36||And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
LUK|19|37||And when he came near to the descent of the place of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and to praise God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty deeds which they had seen.
LUK|19|38||And they said: Blessed be the king, that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory on high.
LUK|19|39||And some of the Pharisees from among the crowd, said to him: Rabbi, rebuke thy disciples.
LUK|19|40||He said to them: I tell you, that, if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.
LUK|19|41||And as he drew near, and beheld the city, he wept over it:
LUK|19|42||and said: O, hadst thou known the things that are of thy peace, at least in this thy day: but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
LUK|19|43||For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies will encompass thee, and besiege thee on every side.
LUK|19|44||And they will destroy thee, and thy children within thee; and will not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
LUK|19|45||And when he entered the temple, he began to expel those who bought and sold in it.
LUK|19|46||And he said to them: It is written, My house is a house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of robbers.
LUK|19|47||And he taught daily in the temple: and the chief priests and Scribes and Elders of the people, sought to destroy him.
LUK|19|48||But they found not, what they could do to him; for all the people hung upon him to hear him.
LUK|20|1||And on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching, the chief priests and Scribes, with the Elders, came upon him,
LUK|20|2||and said to him: Tell us, by what authority thou doest these things? And who is it, that gave thee this authority?
LUK|20|3||Jesus answered, and said to them: I also will ask you a word, and tell ye me.
LUK|20|4||The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
LUK|20|5||And they reasoned with themselves, and said: If we say, From heaven; he will say to us, And why did ye not believe him?
LUK|20|6||But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
LUK|20|7||And they said to him: We do not know, whence it was.
LUK|20|8||Jesus said to them: Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.
LUK|20|9||And he began to utter this similitude to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to cultivators, and went abroad for a long time.
LUK|20|10||And in time, he sent his servant to the cultivators, that they might give him of the fruits of the vineyard. But the cultivators beat him, and sent him away empty.
LUK|20|11||And again he sent another servant; and him also they beat, and treated with rudeness, and sent empty away.
LUK|20|12||And again he sent the third. And they wounded him, and cast him out.
LUK|20|13||The lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my dear son. Perhaps they will look upon him, and be ashamed.
LUK|20|14||But when the cultivators saw him, they reasoned with themselves, and said: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
LUK|20|15||And they cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
LUK|20|16||He will come, and destroy those cultivators, and will lease the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it], they said: This shall not be.
LUK|20|17||And he looked upon them, and said: What is that which is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, is become the chief corner stone?
LUK|20|18||And whoever shall fall upon this stone, will be broken; and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him in pieces.
LUK|20|19||And the chief priests and Scribes sought to lay hands on him, at that time; but they were afraid of the people; for they knew, that he spoke this similitude against them.
LUK|20|20||And they sent to him spies, who feigned themselves righteous men, that they might insnare him in discourse, and deliver him up to a court, and to the authority of the president.
LUK|20|21||And they questioned him, and said to him: Teacher, we know that thou speakest and teachest correctly, and hast no respect of persons, but teachest the way of God in truth.
LUK|20|22||Is it lawful for us to pay head-money to Caesar, or not?
LUK|20|23||But he perceived their craftiness, and said: Why tempt ye me?
LUK|20|24||Show me a denarius. Whose is this image and superscription upon it? They said to him, Caesar's.
LUK|20|25||Jesus said to them: Then, give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.
LUK|20|26||And they could not catch from him a word [of accusation] before the people: and they were surprised at his answers, and were silent.
LUK|20|27||And some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came and questioned him,
LUK|20|28||and said to him: Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if a man's brother die, who had a wife without children, his [surviving] brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his [deceased] brother.
LUK|20|29||Now, there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children.
LUK|20|30||And the second took her to wife; and he died without children.
LUK|20|31||And again, the third took her, and in like manner also all the seven; and they died, and left no children.
LUK|20|32||At last, the woman likewise died.
LUK|20|33||In the resurrection, therefore, of which of them will she be the wife, for the seven took her?
LUK|20|34||Jesus said to them: The children of this world take wives, and wives are given to husbands.
LUK|20|35||But they who are worthy of that world, and of the resurrection from the dead, do not take wives, nor are wives given to husbands.
LUK|20|36||Neither can they die any more; for they are as the angels, and are the children of God, because they are children of the resurrection.
LUK|20|37||But that the dead will arise, even Moses showed; for, at the bush, he maketh mention, while he saith: The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
LUK|20|38||Now God is not [the God] of the dead, but of the living; for they all live to him.
LUK|20|39||And some of the Scribes answered, and said to him: Teacher, thou hast spoken well.
LUK|20|40||And they did not again venture to question him, on any matter.
LUK|20|41||And he said also to them: How do the Scribes say of Messiah, that he is the son of David?
LUK|20|42||And David himself said, in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, seat thyself at my right hand,
LUK|20|43||until I shall place thy foes under thy feet.
LUK|20|44||If David, therefore, called him, My Lord; how is he his son?
LUK|20|45||And while all the people heard, he said to his disciples:
LUK|20|46||Beware of the Scribes, who choose to walk in long robes, and love a salutation in the streets, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief couches at suppers:
LUK|20|47||who eat up the houses of widows, under pretence that they prolong their prayers. They will receive a greater condemnation.
LUK|21|1||And Jesus looked upon the rich, who cast their oblations into the treasury.
LUK|21|2||And he saw also a certain poor widow, who cast in two mites.
LUK|21|3||And he said: Truly I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than any one.
LUK|21|4||For all they, from what was superfluous to them, have cast into the receptacle of oblations to God; but she, from her penury, hath cast in all that she possessed.
LUK|21|5||And when some spoke of the temple, as adorned with goodly stones and oblations, Jesus said to them:
LUK|21|6||[As for] these things, on which ye gaze, the days will come, in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone, that is not cast down.
LUK|21|7||And they questioned him, and said: Teacher, when will these things be? And what is the sign that they are near to take place?
LUK|21|8||And he said to them: See, that ye be not deceived; for many will come in my name, and will say: I am Messiah and the time is near. But go ye not after them.
LUK|21|9||And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not afraid; for these things are previously to take place, but the end is not yet come.
LUK|21|10||For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
LUK|21|11||and great earthquakes will occur in several places, and famines, and pestilences; and there will be terrors, and trepidations, and great signs from heaven will be seen, and there will be great tempests.
LUK|21|12||But before all these things, they will lay hands upon you, and will persecute you, and will deliver you up to councils and to prison, and will arraign you before kings and governors, on account of my name.
LUK|21|13||But it will be to you for a testimony.
LUK|21|14||And settle it in your hearts, that ye will not previously seek instruction for making a defence.
LUK|21|15||For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your enemies will be unable to withstand.
LUK|21|16||And your parents, and your brothers, and your relatives, and your friends, will deliver you up, and cause some of you to die.
LUK|21|17||And ye will be hated by every one, on account of my name.
LUK|21|18||But a hair of your head shall not perish.
LUK|21|19||And by your patience, will ye preserve your souls.
LUK|21|20||And when ye shall see Jerusalem with an army encompassing it, then know ye, that its destruction draweth nigh.
LUK|21|21||Then let them who shall be in Judaea, flee to the mountain [district]; and let them, who are in the midst of it, flee away; and those in the fields, not enter it.
LUK|21|22||For these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.
LUK|21|23||But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse children, in those days; for then will be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
LUK|21|24||And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be carried captive to every place. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be completed.
LUK|21|25||And there will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and distress of nations on the earth; and clasping of hands, from astonishment at the noise of the sea;
LUK|21|26||and dismay that driveth out the souls of men, from fear of that which is to come on the earth; and the powers of heaven will be moved.
LUK|21|27||And then will they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with much power, and with great glory.
LUK|21|28||And when these things shall begin to be, take courage, and lift up your heads, for your deliverance draweth nigh.
LUK|21|29||And he uttered a similitude to them. Look at the fig-tree, and all the trees.
LUK|21|30||When they bud forth, ye at once understand from them that summer approacheth.
LUK|21|31||So also, when ye shall see all these things take place, know ye that the kingdom of God is near.
LUK|21|32||Verily I say to you, That this generation will not pass away, until all these things occur.
LUK|21|33||Heaven and earth will pass away; but my word will not pass away.
LUK|21|34||Take heed to yourselves, that your hearts be, at no time, stupefied by gluttony and ebriety and worldly care; and so that day come upon you unawares.
LUK|21|35||For, like a hunter's snare, it will spring upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole land.
LUK|21|36||Be ye therefore vigilant, at all times, and prayerful; that ye may be worthy to escape the things that are to take place, and may stand before the Son of man .
LUK|21|37||And, in the daytime he taught in the temple, and at night he went out and lodged in the mount, called the Place of Olives.
LUK|21|38||And all the people came early to him in the temple, to hear his discourse.
LUK|22|1||And the feast of unleavened cakes, which is called the passover, drew near.
LUK|22|2||And the chief priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him, for they were afraid of the people.
LUK|22|3||And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
LUK|22|4||And he went and conferred with the chief priests and Scribes, and the military commanders of the temple, how he might betray him to them.
LUK|22|5||And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
LUK|22|6||And he promised them, and sought opportunity to betray him to them, in the absence of the multitude.
LUK|22|7||And the day of unleavened cakes arrived, on which it was customary for the passover to be slain.
LUK|22|8||And Jesus sent Cephas and John, and said to them; Go, prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.
LUK|22|9||And they said to him: Where wilt thou, that we prepare?
LUK|22|10||He said to them: Lo, when ye enter the city, there will a man meet you, bearing a vessel of water. Go after him;
LUK|22|11||and where he entereth, say ye to the lord of the house: Our Rabbi saith, Is there a place of refreshment, in which I may eat the Passover, with my disciples?
LUK|22|12||And lo, he will show you a large upper room that is furnished; there prepare ye.
LUK|22|13||And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.
LUK|22|14||And when the time arrived, Jesus came and reclined; and the twelve Legates with him.
LUK|22|15||And he said to them: I have greatly desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer.
LUK|22|16||For I say to you, That henceforth I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
LUK|22|17||[And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said: Take this, and divide it among you.
LUK|22|18||For I say to you, That I shall not drink of the product of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.]
LUK|22|19||And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to them, and said: This is my body, which is given for your sakes. This do ye, in remembrance of me.
LUK|22|20||And in like manner also concerning the cup, after they had supped, he said: This cup is the new testament in my blood, which, for your sakes, is poured out!
LUK|22|21||But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is on the table.
LUK|22|22||And the Son of man goeth, as it was determined; but woe to that man, by whom he is betrayed.
LUK|22|23||And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was, that would do this.
LUK|22|24||And there was contention also among them, who among them would be greatest.
LUK|22|25||And Jesus said to them: The kings of the nations, are their lords; and those exercising authority over them, are called benefactors.
LUK|22|26||But ye, not so: but he that is great among you, must be as the least; and he that is chief, as the servitor.
LUK|22|27||For, which is the greater, he that reclineth, or he that serveth? Is not he that reclineth? But I am among you, as he that serveth.
LUK|22|28||Ye are they who have continued with me in my trials:
LUK|22|29||and I promise to you, as my Father hath promised to me, a kingdom:
LUK|22|30||that ye may eat and drink at the table of my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
LUK|22|31||And Jesus said to Simon: Simon, lo, Satan hath desired to sift thee, as wheat:
LUK|22|32||but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail. And thou also, in time, turn; and confirm thy brethren.
LUK|22|33||And Simon said to him: My Lord, with thee I am ready, both for prison and for death.
LUK|22|34||Jesus said to him: I tell thee, Simon, the cock will not crow this day, until thou hast three times denied that thou knowest me.
LUK|22|35||And he said to them: When I sent you without purses, without wallets and shoes, lacked ye any thing? They say to him: Nothing.
LUK|22|36||He said to them: Henceforth, let him that hath a purse, take it; and so likewise a wallet. And let him that hath no sword, sell his garment, and buy himself a sword.
LUK|22|37||For I say to you, That this also, which was written, must be fulfilled in me: I shall be numbered with transgressors. For, all that relates to me, will be fulfilled.
LUK|22|38||And they said to him: Our Lord, lo, here are two swords. He said to them: They are sufficient.
LUK|22|39||And he went out, and proceeded, as was his custom, to the mount of the place of Olives; and his disciples followed him.
LUK|22|40||And when he arrived at the place, he said to them: Pray ye, that ye enter not into temptation.
LUK|22|41||And he retired from them, about a stone's throw; and kneeled down, and prayed,
LUK|22|42||and said: Father, if it please thee, let this cup pass from me. Yet not my pleasure, but thine, be done.
LUK|22|43||And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.
LUK|22|44||And as he was in fear, he prayed earnestly; and his sweat was like drops of blood; and it fell on the ground.
LUK|22|45||And he arose from his prayer, and came to his disciples: and he found them sleeping, from sorrow.
LUK|22|46||And he said to them: Why sleep ye? Arise, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
LUK|22|47||And while he was speaking, lo, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, came at their head. And he came up to Jesus, and kissed him. For he had given them this sign: Whom I shall kiss, he it is.
LUK|22|48||Jesus said to him: Judas, is it with a kiss thou betrayest the Son of man?
LUK|22|49||And when they that were with him, saw what occurred, they said to him: Our Lord, shall we smite them with the sword?
LUK|22|50||And one of them smote a servant of the high priest, and took off his right ear.
LUK|22|51||And Jesus answered and said: Sufficient, thus far. And he touched the ear of him that was smitten, and healed him.
LUK|22|52||And Jesus said to those who had come upon him, the chief priests and Elders and military captains of the temple: Have ye come out against me, as against a robber, with swords, and with clubs, to take me?
LUK|22|53||I was with you daily in the temple, and ye laid not hands upon me. But this is your hour, and the reign of darkness.
LUK|22|54||And they took him, and conducted him to the house of the high priest. And Simon followed after him, at a distance.
LUK|22|55||And they kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and sat around it; and Simon also sat among them.
LUK|22|56||And a certain maid saw him sitting at the fire, and she looked upon him, and said: This man also was with him.
LUK|22|57||But he denied, and said: Woman, I have not known him.
LUK|22|58||And a little after, another [person] saw him, and said to him: Thou too art one of them. And Cephas said: I am not.
LUK|22|59||And an hour after, another contended and said: Certainly, this man also was with him, for he likewise is a Galilean.
LUK|22|60||Cephas said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was speaking, the cock crew.
LUK|22|61||And Jesus turned, and looked upon Cephas. And Simon remembered the word of our Lord, which he spoke to him: Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me three times.
LUK|22|62||And Simon went out, and wept bitterly.
LUK|22|63||And the men who had taken Jesus, insulted him, and blinded him,
LUK|22|64||and smote him on his face, and said: Prophesy thou, who smote thee?
LUK|22|65||And many other things they revilingly uttered, and spoke against him.
LUK|22|66||And when the day dawned, the Elders and chief priests and Scribes assembled together; and they led him to the place of their meeting,
LUK|22|67||and said to him: If thou art the Messiah, tell us. He said to them: If I tell you, ye will not believe in me.
LUK|22|68||And if I should ask you, ye will not return me an answer; nor will ye release me.
LUK|22|69||From this time, the Son of man will sit on the right hand of the majesty of God.
LUK|22|70||And they all said: Thou art then, the Son of God? Jesus said to them: Ye say that I am.
LUK|22|71||They say: What further need have we of witnesses? For we have heard from his own mouth.
LUK|23|1||And the whole company of them arose, and carried him before Pilate.
LUK|23|2||And they began to accuse him, and said: We have found this man seducing our people, and forbidding to pay the capitation money to Caesar, and declaring himself to be king Messiah.
LUK|23|3||And Pilate interrogated him, and said to him: Art thou king of the Jews? He said to him: Thou hast said.
LUK|23|4||And Pilate said to the chief priests and the company: I find no crime upon this man.
LUK|23|5||And they vociferated, and said: He raiseth disturbance among our people, by teaching in all Judaea, commencing from Galilee, and quite to this place.
LUK|23|6||And Pilate, when he heard the name Galilee, inquired if the man were a Galilean.
LUK|23|7||And having learned that he was from under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod; for he was at Jerusalem on those days.
LUK|23|8||And Herod rejoiced greatly when he saw Jesus, for he had been desirous to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to see some sign from him.
LUK|23|9||And he asked him many questions; but Jesus gave him no reply.
LUK|23|10||And the chief priests and Scribes stood up, and accused him vehemently.
LUK|23|11||And Herod and his warriors contemned him. And when he had mocked him, he clothed him in a purple robe, and sent him to Pilate.
LUK|23|12||And on that day, Pilate and Herod became friends to each other; for there had previously been enmity between them.
LUK|23|13||And Pilate called the chief priests and the rulers of the people,
LUK|23|14||and said to them: Ye have brought this man before me, as a disturber of your people; and lo, I have examined him before you, and I find in the man no crime, among all that ye charge upon him.
LUK|23|15||Neither yet Herod: for I sent him to him, and lo, nothing deserving death hath been done by him.
LUK|23|16||I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
LUK|23|17||For it was a custom, that he should release one at the festival.
LUK|23|18||And all the company vociferated, and said: Away with this man; and release to us Barabbas.
LUK|23|19||He was one who had been thrown into prison, on account of a sedition and murder which had occurred in the city.
LUK|23|20||And Pilate, being disposed to release Jesus, conversed with them again.
LUK|23|21||But they cried out, and said: Crucify him; crucify him.
LUK|23|22||And he said to them the third time: But, what evil hath he done? I find no crime in him deserving of death. I will scourge him, therefore, and release him.
LUK|23|23||But they were urgent, with a loud voice; and demanded of him, that they might crucify him.
LUK|23|24||And Pilate decreed, that their request be granted.
LUK|23|25||And he released to them him, who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, for whom they petitioned; and he delivered up Jesus to their pleasure.
LUK|23|26||And as they led him away, they seized Simon the Cyrenian, coming from the fields. and laid upon him the cross, to bear [it] after Jesus.
LUK|23|27||And there followed after him a great multitude of people; and those women [also] who wailed and lamented over him.
LUK|23|28||And Jesus turned to them, and said to them: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me; but weep rather for yourselves, and for your children.
LUK|23|29||For lo, the days are coming, in which they will say: Happy the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.
LUK|23|30||Then will they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us! and to the hills, Cover us!
LUK|23|31||For if they do these things in a green tree, what will be in the dry?
LUK|23|32||And there went along with him two others, malefactors, to be crucified.
LUK|23|33||And when they came to a certain place which is called a Skull, they crucified him there; and the two malefactors, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
LUK|23|34||And Jesus said: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, casting a lot upon them.
LUK|23|35||And the people stood and looked on; and the rulers also derided him, and said: He quickened others; let him quicken himself, if he is the Messiah, the chosen of God.
LUK|23|36||And the soldiers like wise mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
LUK|23|37||and saying to him: If thou art the king of the Jews, quicken thyself.
LUK|23|38||And there was likewise a superscription over him, written in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
LUK|23|39||And one of the malefactors who were crucified with him, reproached him, and said: If thou art the Messiah, rescue thyself, and rescue us.
LUK|23|40||But his fellow [Malefactor] rebuked him, said to him: Art thou not afraid even of God, seeing thou art under the same sentence?
LUK|23|41||And we justly; for we have a retribution according to our deserts, and according to our deeds; but nothing hateful hath been done by him.
LUK|23|42||And he said to Jesus: My Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy kingdom.
LUK|23|43||Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, That this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.
LUK|23|44||And it was about the sixth hour; and darkness was over all the land, until the ninth hour.
LUK|23|45||And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the door of the temple was rent through its middle.
LUK|23|46||And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said: My Father, into thy hand I commit my spirit. Thus he spake, and expired.
LUK|23|47||And when the centurion saw what occurred, he glorified God and said: Certainly, this was a righteous man.
LUK|23|48||And all the multitudes who had assembled at this spectacle, on seeing what occurred, returned, smiting upon their breasts.
LUK|23|49||And there were standing at a distance, all they that knew Jesus, and those women who came with him from Galilee; and they beheld these things.
LUK|23|50||And there was a certain man, whose name was Joseph, a counsellor, from Ramath a city of Judaea, who was a good man and righteous;
LUK|23|51||and he had not consented to their decision and deed; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
LUK|23|52||This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
LUK|23|53||And he took it down, and wrapped it in a winding-sheet of linen; and laid it in an excavated sepulchre, in which no one had hitherto been laid.
LUK|23|54||And it was the day of preparation, and the sabbath began to dawn.
LUK|23|55||And those women who came with him from Galilee, approached, and viewed the sepulchre, and the manner in which the body was deposited.
LUK|23|56||And they returned, and prepared perfumes and aromatics; and they rested on the sabbath, as it is commanded.
LUK|24|1||And on the first day of the week, in the morning, while it was yet dark, they came to the sepulchre, and brought the aromatics they had prepared. And there were other women with them.
LUK|24|2||And they found the stone rolled from the sepulchre.
LUK|24|3||And they entered, and found not the body of Jesus.
LUK|24|4||And as they wondered at this, behold, two men stood opposite them; and their raiment was effulgent.
LUK|24|5||And they were in fear, and bowed their faces to the ground. And the men said to them: Why seek ye the living among the dead?
LUK|24|6||He is not here; he is risen. Remember how he conversed with you, when he was in Galilee,
LUK|24|7||and said, That the Son of man was to be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and to rise on the third day.
LUK|24|8||And they remembered his words.
LUK|24|9||And they returned from the sepulchre, and related all these things to the eleven, and to the rest.
LUK|24|10||Now they were Mary Magdalena, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the others with them, who related these things to the Legates.
LUK|24|11||And these words appeared in their eyes as dreams: and they believed them not.
LUK|24|12||But Simon arose, and ran to the sepulchre, and looked in, and saw the linen lying by itself: and he went away wondering in himself at what had occurred.
LUK|24|13||And lo, two of them, on the same day, were going to a village named Emmaus, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.
LUK|24|14||And they talked together of all that had occurred.
LUK|24|15||And as they conversed, and questioned each other, Jesus came, and drew near, and walked with them.
LUK|24|16||And their eyes were held, that they did not recognize him.
LUK|24|17||And he said to them: What are these discourses, which ye hold with each other, as ye walk and are sad?
LUK|24|18||And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, that thou knowest not the things that have occurred there in these days?
LUK|24|19||He said to them: What things? They say to him: In regard to Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet, and mighty in discourse and in action, before God, and before all the people.
LUK|24|20||And the chief priests and Elders delivered him up to a sentence of death, and crucified him.
LUK|24|21||But we expected that he was to deliver Israel. And lo, three days [have passed], since all these things occurred.
LUK|24|22||And moreover, certain women of ours astonished us; for they went early to the sepulchre;
LUK|24|23||and as they did not find the body, they came and said to us: We saw angels there, and they said that he is alive.
LUK|24|24||And also some of us went to the sepulchre; and they found, as the women reported; but him they saw not.
LUK|24|25||Then Jesus said to them: O deficient in understanding, and slow of heart to believe all the things that the prophets uttered.
LUK|24|26||Were not these things to be; that the Messiah should suffer and that he should enter into his glory?
LUK|24|27||Then he began from Moses, and from all the prophets, and expounded to them concerning himself from all the scriptures.
LUK|24|28||And they drew near to the village to which they were going; and he made them feel, as if he would go to a more distant place.
LUK|24|29||And they urged him, and said to him: Tarry with us, for the day inclineth towards dark. And he went in to remain with them.
LUK|24|30||And it occurred, while he reclined with them, that he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.
LUK|24|31||And instantly, their eyes were opened, and, they knew him. And he took himself from them.
LUK|24|32||And they said one to another: Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and explained to us the scriptures?
LUK|24|33||And they arose, the same hour, and returned: to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven assembled, and those with them,
LUK|24|34||who were saying: Certainly, our Lord hath risen; and he hath appeared to Simon.
LUK|24|35||And they also related what occurred by the way, and how he became known to them, when he broke bread.
LUK|24|36||And while they were talking of these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be with you! It is I; be not afraid.
LUK|24|37||And they were in trepidation and fear, for they supposed they saw a spirit.
LUK|24|38||Jesus said to them: Why are ye agitated? And why do imaginations arise in your hearts?
LUK|24|39||Look at my hands and my feet, that it is myself. Handle me, and know; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
LUK|24|40||And as he said thus, he showed them his hands and his feet.
LUK|24|41||And while they still believed not, for their joy, and were astonished; he said to them: Have ye here any thing to eat?
LUK|24|42||And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of honeycomb.
LUK|24|43||And he took, [and] ate before them.
LUK|24|44||And he said to them: These are the things which I said to you while I was with you, That all things written of me, in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms, must be fulfilled.
LUK|24|45||Then he opened their mind to understand the scriptures.
LUK|24|46||And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it was right for Messiah to suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day;
LUK|24|47||and that, in his name, repentance for the remission of sins should be preached among all nations, and that the commencement be at Jerusalem.
LUK|24|48||And ye are the witnesses of these things.
LUK|24|49||And I will send upon you the promise of my Father. But remain ye at Jerusalem until ye shall be clothed with energy from on high.
LUK|24|50||And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted his hands, and blessed them.
LUK|24|51||And it occurred, while he blessed them, that he was separated from them, and ascended to heaven.
LUK|24|52||And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
LUK|24|53||And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
JHN|1|1||In the beginning, was the Word; and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.
JHN|1|2||He was in the beginning with God.
JHN|1|3||Every thing was by his hand; and without him, was not any thing whatever that existed.
JHN|1|4||In him was life; and the life was the light of man.
JHN|1|5||And this light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
JHN|1|6||There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
JHN|1|7||He came for testimony, to bear witness concerning the light.
JHN|1|8||He was not himself the light, but [came] to bear witness concerning the light.
JHN|1|9||The true light was that, which enlighteneth every man who cometh into the world.
JHN|1|10||He was in the world; and the world was by his hand; and the world did not know him.
JHN|1|11||He came to his own [people]; and his own [people] received him not.
JHN|1|12||But such as received him, to them gave he the prerogative to be children of God; [even] to them that believe on his name;
JHN|1|13||who are born, not of blood, nor of the pleasure of the flesh, nor of the pleasure of man, but of God.
JHN|1|14||And the: Word became flesh, and tabernacled with us: and we saw his glory, a glory as of the only begotten from the Father, that he was full of grace and truth.
JHN|1|15||John testified of him, and cried, and said: This is he, of whom I said, That he cometh after me, and is before me; for he was prior to me.
JHN|1|16||And of his plenitude have we all received, and grace for grace.
JHN|1|17||For the law was given by the hand of Moses; but the reality and grace was by the hand of Jesus Messiah.
JHN|1|18||No man hath ever seen God; the only begotten God, he who is in the bosom of his Father, he hath declared [him].
JHN|1|19||And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites, to ask him, Who art thou?
JHN|1|20||And he confessed, and denied not, but confessed I am not the Messiah.
JHN|1|21||And they asked him again: Who then? Art thou Elijah? And he said: I am not. Art thou a prophet? And he said, No.
JHN|1|22||And they said to him: Who art thou? that we may give answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
JHN|1|23||He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make smooth the way of the Lord; as said the prophet Isaiah.
JHN|1|24||And they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.
JHN|1|25||And they asked him, and said to him: Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor a prophet?
JHN|1|26||John answered, and said to them; I baptize with water; but among you standeth one, whom ye do not know.
JHN|1|27||He it is that cometh after me, and was before me, whose shoe-strings I am not worthy to untie.
JHN|1|28||These things occurred in Bethany, where John was baptizing.
JHN|1|29||The day after, John saw Jesus coming towards him, and said: Behold, the Lamb of God, that beareth the sin of the world.
JHN|1|30||This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who is before me, for he was prior to me.
JHN|1|31||And I knew him not; but that he might be known to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
JHN|1|32||And John testified, and said: I saw the Spirit descend from heaven, as a dove, and rest upon him.
JHN|1|33||And I did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, On whom thou seest the Spirit descend, and rest upon him, he baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
JHN|1|34||And I saw; and I testify, that this is the Son of God.
JHN|1|35||And the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples.
JHN|1|36||And he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and said: Behold, the Lamb of God!
JHN|1|37||And his two disciples heard him when he said [it], and they went after Jesus.
JHN|1|38||And Jesus turned, and saw them coming after him, and he said to them: What seek ye? They said to him: Our Rabbi, where stayest thou?
JHN|1|39||He said to them: Come, and see. And they came and saw where he lodged; and they were with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
JHN|1|40||And one of those who heard John and went after Jesus was Andrew, the brother of Simon.
JHN|1|41||He first saw Simon his brother, and said to him: We have found the Messiah.
JHN|1|42||And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looked upon him, and said Thou art Simon the son of Jona; thou shalt be called Cephas.
JHN|1|43||The next day, Jesus was disposed to depart for Galilee: and he found Philip and said to him, Come after me.
JHN|1|44||And Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Simon.
JHN|1|45||And Philip found Nathaniel, and said to him: We have found him, of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is of Nazareth.
JHN|1|46||Nathaniel said to him: Can there be any good thing from Nazareth? Philip said to him: Come, and see.
JHN|1|47||And Jesus saw Nathaniel coming towards him, and said of him: Behold a real Israelite, in whom is no deceit.
JHN|1|48||Nathaniel said to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus said to him: Before Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
JHN|1|49||Nathaniel answered, and said to him: Rabbi; thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
JHN|1|50||Jesus said to him: Because I said to thee, that I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou wilt see greater things than these.
JHN|1|51||He said to him: Verily, verily, I say to you, That hereafter ye will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending unto the Son of man.
JHN|2|1||And on the third day there was a feast in Cana, a city of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.
JHN|2|2||And also Jesus and his disciples were invited to the feast.
JHN|2|3||And the wine fell short: and his mother said to Jesus: They have no wine.
JHN|2|4||Jesus said to her: What is [in common] to me and thee? Not yet hath my hour come.
JHN|2|5||His mother said to the waiters: Whatever he saith to you, do [it].
JHN|2|6||And there were there six waterpots of stone, set for the purification of Jews, containing each two or three quadrantalia.
JHN|2|7||Jesus said to them: Fill those water-pots with water. And they filled them to the top.
JHN|2|8||He said to them: Draw now, and carry to the master of the feast. And they carried.
JHN|2|9||And when the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know whence it came, although the waiters knew, as they had filled the pots with water, the master of the feast called the bridegroom,
JHN|2|10||and said to him: Every man first bringeth forward the good wine, and when they are satiated, then that which is inferior; but thou hast kept the good wine till now.
JHN|2|11||This is the first sign, which Jesus wrought at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory: and his disciples believed on him.
JHN|2|12||Afterwards he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and they were there a few days.
JHN|2|13||And the pass over of the Jews drew near; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN|2|14||And he found in the temple those who sold beeves and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting [there].
JHN|2|15||And he made himself a whip from a cord, and turned them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the beeves and the money-changers; and he poured out their money, and overset their tables:
JHN|2|16||and he said to them that sold doves, Take away these things; and make not my Father's house a house of traffic.
JHN|2|17||And his disciples remembered, that it is written: The zeal of thy house hath devoured me.
JHN|2|18||But the Jews replied, and said to him: What sign showest thou to us, since thou doest these things?
JHN|2|19||Jesus answered, and said to them: Demolish this temple, and in three days I will again erect it.
JHN|2|20||The Jews said to him: Forty and six years, this temple was building; and wilt thou build it again in three days?
JHN|2|21||But he spake of the temple of his body.
JHN|2|22||And when he was arisen from the dead, his disciples remembered, that he spoke this: and they believed the scriptures, and the word that Jesus spake.
JHN|2|23||And while Jesus was in Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover, many believed on him, because they saw the signs he wrought.
JHN|2|24||But Jesus did not confide himself to them; because he knew all men:
JHN|2|25||And he needed not that any one should testify to him respecting any man; for he himself knew what is in man.
JHN|3|1||And there was a man of the Pharisees there, whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
JHN|3|2||And he came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher sent from God; for no one can work those signs which thou workest, unless God be with him.
JHN|3|3||Jesus replied, and said to him: Verily, verily, I say to thee, That, unless a man be born anew, he cannot behold the kingdom of God.
JHN|3|4||Nicodemus said to him: How can an old man be born? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?
JHN|3|5||Jesus replied, and said to him Verily, verily, I say to thee, That, unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
JHN|3|6||That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
JHN|3|7||Be not surprised that I said to thee, Ye must be born anew.
JHN|3|8||The wind bloweth where it chooseth; and thou hearest its sound, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one, that is born of the Spirit.
JHN|3|9||Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things be?
JHN|3|10||Jesus answered, and said to him: Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
JHN|3|11||Verily, verily, I say to thee: We speak, what we know; and we testify to what we have seen; but ye receive not our testimony.
JHN|3|12||If I have spoken to you of things on earth, and ye believe not; how will ye believe, if I speak of things in heaven?
JHN|3|13||And no one hath ascended to heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.
JHN|3|14||And as Moses elevated the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:
JHN|3|15||that every one who believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life eternal.
JHN|3|16||For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, should not perish, but should have life eternal.
JHN|3|17||For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world; but that the world might live by means of him.
JHN|3|18||He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is already condemned; because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
JHN|3|19||And this is the [ground of] condemnation, that light hath come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, for their deeds have been evil.
JHN|3|20||For every one that doeth abominable things, hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
JHN|3|21||But he that doeth right, cometh to the light, that his works may be known to be done in God.
JHN|3|22||After these things, came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them, and baptized.
JHN|3|23||And John also was baptizing in non, which is near to Salim, because there were many waters there: and the people came, and were baptized.
JHN|3|24||For John had not yet fallen into prison.
JHN|3|25||And one of John's disciples and a certain Jew had disputed respecting purification.
JHN|3|26||And they came to John, and said to him: Our Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, and of whom thou gavest testimony, lo, he also baptizeth; and many go after him.
JHN|3|27||John answered, and said to them: A man cannot take any thing by his own choice, unless it be given him from heaven.
JHN|3|28||Ye are witnesses for me, that I said: I am not the Messiah, but am sent to go before him.
JHN|3|29||He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: and the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and listeneth to him, rejoiceth with great joy on account of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy, therefore, lo, it is full.
JHN|3|30||To him must be increase, and to me decrease.
JHN|3|31||For he that cometh from above, is above all; and he that is from the earth, is of the earth, and talketh of the earth. He that cometh from heaven, is above all;
JHN|3|32||and what he hath seen and heard, he testifieth; and his testimony, no one receiveth.
JHN|3|33||But he that receiveth his testimony, hath set his seal, that God is true.
JHN|3|34||For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God; for God hath not given the Spirit by measure [to him].
JHN|3|35||The Father loveth the Son, and hath given every thing into his hands.
JHN|3|36||He that believeth on the Son, hath life eternal; but he who obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life. but the wrath of God will abide upon him.
JHN|4|1||And Jesus knew, that the Pharisees had heard; that he made many disciples, and baptized more than John.
JHN|4|2||Yet Jesus himself did not baptize but his disciples.
JHN|4|3||And he left Judaea, and went again into Galilee.
JHN|4|4||And in going, he had occasion to pass through the midst of the Samaritans.
JHN|4|5||And he came to a city of the Samaritans called Sychar, near the field which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
JHN|4|6||And Jacob's well of water was there. And Jesus was weary with the toil of travelling, and seated himself by the well: and it was at the sixth hour.
JHN|4|7||And a woman from Samaria came to draw water. And Jesus said to her: Give me water to drink.
JHN|4|8||And his disciples had gone to the city, to buy themselves food.
JHN|4|9||The Samaritan woman said to him: How dost thou, a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews have no familiarity with Samaritans.
JHN|4|10||Jesus replied and said to her: If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living waters.
JHN|4|11||The woman said to him: My lord, thou hast no bucket, and the well is deep.; how hast thou living waters?
JHN|4|12||Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well, and drank from it himself, and his children, and his flocks?
JHN|4|13||Jesus replied and said to her: Whoever shall drink of these waters, will thirst again;
JHN|4|14||but whoever shall drink of the waters which I shall give him, will not thirst for ever; but the waters, which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of waters, springing up unto life eternal.
JHN|4|15||The woman said to him: My lord, give me of these waters, that I may not thirst again, and may not come to draw from here.
JHN|4|16||Jesus said to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
JHN|4|17||She said to him: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast well said, I have no husband;
JHN|4|18||for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. In this thou didst speak truly.
JHN|4|19||The woman said to him: My lord, I perceive thou art a prophet.
JHN|4|20||Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where it is proper to worship.
JHN|4|21||Jesus said to her: Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, ye will worship the Father.
JHN|4|22||Ye worship, ye know not what; but we worship what we know; for life is from the Jews.
JHN|4|23||But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father requireth that worshippers be such.
JHN|4|24||For God is a Spirit; and they that worship him, should worship in spirit and in truth.
JHN|4|25||The woman said to him: I know that Messiah will come; and when he cometh, he will teach us every thing.
JHN|4|26||Jesus said to her: I, who talk with thee, am he.
JHN|4|27||And while he was speaking, his disciples came. And they wondered that he would converse with the woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
JHN|4|28||And the woman left her water-pot, and went to the city, and said [to the people]:
JHN|4|29||Come, see a man that told me every thing I ever did: is not this the Messiah?
JHN|4|30||And the people went out of the city, and came to him.
JHN|4|31||In the mean time, his disciples entreated him, and said to him: Our Rabbi, eat.
JHN|4|32||But he said to them: I have food to eat, of which ye are ignorant.
JHN|4|33||The disciples said among themselves: Hath any one brought him something to eat?
JHN|4|34||Jesus said to them: My food is to do the pleasure of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
JHN|4|35||Do ye not say, that after four months cometh the harvest? Behold, I say to you, and lift up your eyes, and look upon the grounds, that they are white, and have already come to the harvest.
JHN|4|36||And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruits unto life eternal; and the sower and the reaper equally rejoice.
JHN|4|37||For in this, is the proverb true, that one is the sower, and another the reaper.
JHN|4|38||I sent you to reap that, on which ye labored not: for others toiled, and ye entered into their labor.
JHN|4|39||And many Samaritans of that city believed on him, because of the discourse of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I ever did.
JHN|4|40||And when these Samaritans came to him, they requested him to tarry with them; and he remained with them two days.
JHN|4|41||And many believed on him, because of his discourse.
JHN|4|42||And they said to the woman: Henceforth we believe in him, not on account of thy word; for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he truly is the Messiah, the Life-Giver of the world.
JHN|4|43||And after two days Jesus departed from there and went into Galilee.
JHN|4|44||For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet is not honored in his own city.
JHN|4|45||And when he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the signs which he wrought in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.
JHN|4|46||And Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a king's servant, whose son was sick.
JHN|4|47||He heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee; and he went to him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son; for he was near dying.
JHN|4|48||Jesus said to him: Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
JHN|4|49||The king's servant said to him: My lord, come down, before the child dieth.
JHN|4|50||Jesus said to him: Go, thy son liveth. And the man believed the word which Jesus spake to him, and went away.
JHN|4|51||And as he was going down, his servants met him, and informed him and said to him: Thy son liveth.
JHN|4|52||And he asked them, at what time he recovered. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour the fever left him.
JHN|4|53||And his father knew, that it was at the hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth. And he believed, and all his house.
JHN|4|54||This again was the second sign that Jesus wrought, when he came from Judaea to Galilee.
JHN|5|1||After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN|5|2||And there was there in Jerusalem a certain place of baptizing, which was called in Hebrew Bethesda; and there were in it five porches.
JHN|5|3||And in them were laid a great multitude of the sick, and the blind, and the lame, and the withered, waiting for the moving of the waters.
JHN|5|4||For an angel, from time to time, descended into the baptistery, and moved the waters; and he who first went in, after the moving of the waters, was cured of whatever disease he had.
JHN|5|5||And a certain man was there, who had been diseased thirty and eight years.
JHN|5|6||Jesus saw him lying, and knew that [his disease] had been a long time upon him, and said to him: Desirest thou to be healed?
JHN|5|7||And the sick man answered and said: Yes, my lord; but I have no one who, when the water is moved, will put me into the baptistery; but while I am coming, another descendeth before me.
JHN|5|8||Jesus said to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
JHN|5|9||And immediately the man was healed; and he arose, took up his bed, and walked; and it was the sabbath day.
JHN|5|10||And the Jews said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to bear thy bed.
JHN|5|11||But he answered, and said to them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.
JHN|5|12||And they asked him: Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?
JHN|5|13||But the man that was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus had slid away, in the great multitude that was in the place.
JHN|5|14||After a time, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: Lo, thou art healed; sin not again, lest something worse come upon thee than before.
JHN|5|15||And the man went and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had cured him.
JHN|5|16||And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him; because he had done these things on the sabbath.
JHN|5|17||But Jesus said to them: My Father worketh until now, and I work.
JHN|5|18||And for this, the Jews sought the more to kill him, not only because he had broken the sabbath, but because he had said of God, that he was his Father, and had equalled himself with God.
JHN|5|19||And Jesus answered, and said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you: The Son can do nothing, of his own pleasure, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things the Father doeth, these in like manner doeth the Son.
JHN|5|20||For the Father loveth his Son, and showeth him every thing he doeth: and greater works than these, will he show him, that ye may wonder.
JHN|5|21||For as the Father raiseth the dead, and vivifieth them; so also the Son vivifieth whom he pleaseth.
JHN|5|22||For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son:
JHN|5|23||that every man may honor the Son, as he honoreth the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father that sent him.
JHN|5|24||Verily, verily, I say to you, That he who heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath life eternal, and will not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death to life.
JHN|5|25||Verily, verily, I say to you, That the hour cometh, and even now come, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear, will live.
JHN|5|26||For, as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also, to have life in himself:
JHN|5|27||and hath moreover given him authority to execute judgment. But that he is the Son of man,
JHN|5|28||wonder not at this; for the hour cometh when all that are in their graves will hear his voice;
JHN|5|29||and will come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
JHN|5|30||I can do nothing of my own pleasure; but as I hear, so I judge. And my judgment is just; for I seek not my own pleasure, but the pleasure of him that sent me.
JHN|5|31||If I should bear testimony respecting myself, my testimony would not be valid.
JHN|5|32||There is another that beareth testimony concerning me; and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true.
JHN|5|33||Ye sent unto John; and he bore testimony to the truth.
JHN|5|34||And I have not received testimony from men: but these things I say, that ye may live.
JHN|5|35||He was a burning and shining lamp; and ye were willing for a time, to glory in his light.
JHN|5|36||But I have a testimony, which is greater than that of John; for the works which my Father hath given me to accomplish, these works which I do, testify of me that the Father hath sent me.
JHN|5|37||And the Father who sent me, he testifieth of me. Ye have not at any time heard his voice, nor have ye seen his visage.
JHN|5|38||And his word abideth not in you, because ye believe not in him whom he hath sent.
JHN|5|39||Search the scriptures; for in them, ye think, there is life eternal for you; and they testify of me.
JHN|5|40||And ye are unwilling to come to me, that life eternal may be yours.
JHN|5|41||I do not receive glory from men.
JHN|5|42||But I know you, that the love of God is not in you.
JHN|5|43||I came in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
JHN|5|44||How can ye believe, who receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory which cometh from God only?
JHN|5|45||Do ye suppose, that I shall accuse you before the Father? There is one that will accuse you, that Moses, on whom ye rely.
JHN|5|46||For, if ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me; for Moses wrote concerning me.
JHN|5|47||But if ye believe not his writings, how will ye believe my words?
JHN|6|1||After these things, Jesus went to the other side of the sea of Galilee [or] of Tiberias.
JHN|6|2||And great multitudes went after him; because they had seen the signs which he wrought upon the sick.
JHN|6|3||And Jesus ascended a mountain, and there he seated himself with his disciples.
JHN|6|4||And the feast of the Jewish passover was near.
JHN|6|5||And Jesus raised his eyes, and saw a great multitude coming towards him; and he said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
JHN|6|6||And this he said, to try him; for he knew what he was about to do.
JHN|6|7||Philip said to him: Two hundred denarii in bread would not suffice them, that each might take but a little.
JHN|6|8||One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Cephas, said to him:
JHN|6|9||There is a lad here, who hath with him five cakes of barley, and two fishes; but what are these for all those [people]?
JHN|6|10||Jesus said to them: Make all the people recline. Now there was much grass in that place: and the people reclined, in number five thousand.
JHN|6|11||And Jesus took the bread, and blessed, and distributed to them that reclined. And so also, with the fish; as much as they desired.
JHN|6|12||And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.
JHN|6|13||And they collected and filled twelve baskets, with fragments of what remained to them that had eaten of the five barley cakes.
JHN|6|14||And those people, when they saw the sign which Jesus had wrought, said: Certainly, this is that prophet who was to come into the world.
JHN|6|15||And Jesus knew, that they were about to come and take him by force, and make him king: and he retired into a mountain alone.
JHN|6|16||And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea,
JHN|6|17||and sat in a ship, and were going over to Capernaum. And darkness came on, and Jesus had not come to them.
JHN|6|18||And the sea was boisterous against them, for a violent wind was blowing.
JHN|6|19||And they had gone about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, when they saw Jesus walking upon the sea: and as he drew near to the ship, they were afraid.
JHN|6|20||But Jesus said to them: It is I; be not afraid.
JHN|6|21||And they were glad to receive him into the ship. And, directly, the ship was at the land to which they were going.
JHN|6|22||And the next day, the multitude, who had remained on the other side of the sea, saw that there was no other ship there, except that in which the disciples embarked, and that Jesus did not embark in that ship with his disciples;
JHN|6|23||yet that other ships had come from Tiberias, near to the place where they ate the bread when Jesus blessed [it].
JHN|6|24||And when the multitude saw, that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples; they embarked in ships, and came to Capernaum, and sought for Jesus.
JHN|6|25||And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him: Our Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
JHN|6|26||Jesus replied and said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the signs, but because ye ate the bread and were satisfied.
JHN|6|27||Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that abideth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give to you; for him hath God the Father sealed.
JHN|6|28||They said to him: What shall we do, in order to work the works of God?
JHN|6|29||Jesus replied and said to them: This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
JHN|6|30||They say to him: What sign doest thou, that we may see and believe in thee? What workest thou?
JHN|6|31||Our fathers ate the manna, in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
JHN|6|32||Jesus said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the real bread from heaven.
JHN|6|33||For the bread of God is, he that came down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.
JHN|6|34||They say to him: Our Lord, give us at all times this bread.
JHN|6|35||Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall not hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall not thirst, for ever.
JHN|6|36||But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and do not believe.
JHN|6|37||All that my Father gave me, will come to me: and him, that cometh to me, I will not cast out.
JHN|6|38||For I came down from heaven, not to do my own pleasure, but the pleasure of him that sent me.
JHN|6|39||And this is the pleasure of him that sent me, that whatever he hath given me, I should lose nothing of it, but should raise it up at the last day.
JHN|6|40||For this is the pleasure of my Father, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have life eternal; and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN|6|41||Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said: I am the bread, who have descended from heaven.
JHN|6|42||And they said: Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? And how doth he say: I came down from heaven?
JHN|6|43||Jesus replied and said to them: Murmur not, one with another.
JHN|6|44||No man can come to me, unless the Father who sent me, shall draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN|6|45||For it is written, in the prophet: And they shall all be taught of God. Whoever, therefore, heareth from the Father, and learneth from him, cometh to me.
JHN|6|46||Not that any one hath seen the Father, except him who hath come from God; he it is, hath seen the Father.
JHN|6|47||Verily, verily, I say to you: That, to him who believeth in me, there is life eternal.
JHN|6|48||I am the bread of life.
JHN|6|49||Your fathers ate the manna, in the wilderness, and they died.
JHN|6|50||But this is the bread which cometh from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.
JHN|6|51||I am the bread of life, who have come down from heaven: and if a man shall eat of this bread, he will live for ever. And the bread which I shall give, is my body, which I give for the life of the world.
JHN|6|52||Then the Jews contended one with another, and said: How can he give us his body to eat?
JHN|6|53||And Jesus said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, That, unless ye eat the body of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life within you.
JHN|6|54||But he that eateth of my body, and drinketh of my blood, to him is life eternal; and I will raise him up at the last day
JHN|6|55||For my body truly is food, and my blood truly is drink.
JHN|6|56||He that eateth my body, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him
JHN|6|57||As the living Father hath sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that shall eat me, he also will live because of me.
JHN|6|58||This is the bread that came down from heaven: not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; whoever shall eat of this bead, will live for ever.
JHN|6|59||These things he uttered in the synagogue, while teaching at Capernaum.
JHN|6|60||And many of his disciples who heard [him], said: This is a hard speech, who can hear it.
JHN|6|61||And Jesus knew in himself, that his disciples murmured at this; and he said to them, Doth this stumble you?
JHN|6|62||If then, ye were to see the Son of man ascend, to where he was from the beginning!
JHN|6|63||It is the Spirit that vivifieth; the body profiteth nothing. The words which I have used with you, they are spirit, and they are life.
JHN|6|64||But there are some of you, that believe not. For Jesus knew, from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who it was that would betray him.
JHN|6|65||And he said to them: For this reason, I said to you, That no one can come to me, unless it be given to him by my Father.
JHN|6|66||On account of this speech, many of his disciples turned back, and walked not with him.
JHN|6|67||And Jesus said to the twelve: Are ye also disposed to go away?
JHN|6|68||Simon Cephas replied, and said: My Lord, to whom shall we go? The words of life eternal are with thee.
JHN|6|69||And we believe, and know, that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
JHN|6|70||Jesus said to them: Have not I chosen you twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.
JHN|6|71||This he spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was afterwards to betray him, being one of the twelve.
JHN|7|1||After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to slay him.
JHN|7|2||And the Jewish feast of tabernacles drew near.
JHN|7|3||And the brothers of Jesus said to him: Leave here, and go into Judaea; that thy disciples may see the works thou doest.
JHN|7|4||For there is no one who doeth any thing in secret, while he wisheth to become public. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.
JHN|7|5||For even his brothers did not believe in Jesus.
JHN|7|6||Jesus said to them: My time hath not yet come: but your time is always ready.
JHN|7|7||The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth; because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.
JHN|7|8||Go ye up to the feast; I do not go up to this feast now, because my time is not yet completed.
JHN|7|9||These things he said, and remained still in Galilee.
JHN|7|10||But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as it were secretly.
JHN|7|11||And the Jews sought for him at the feast; and they said, Where is he?
JHN|7|12||And there was much altercation among the people respecting him; for some said, He is a good man; while others said, No, but he deceiveth the people.
JHN|7|13||Yet no one spoke openly of him, from fear of the Jews.
JHN|7|14||And in the midst of the days of the feast, Jesus went into the temple, and taught.
JHN|7|15||And the Jews wondered, and said: How knoweth this man literature, having not been educated?
JHN|7|16||Jesus answered and said: My doctrine is not from me, but from him that sent me.
JHN|7|17||He that wisheth to do his pleasure, will understand my doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from my own pleasure.
JHN|7|18||He that speaketh according to the pleasure of his own mind, seeketh glory for himself: but he who seeketh the glory of him that sent him, is veracious, and evil is not in his heart.
JHN|7|19||Did not Moses give you the law? Yet no one of you observeth the law.
JHN|7|20||Why do ye seek to kill me? The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
JHN|7|21||Jesus replied, and said to them: I have wrought one work, and ye all wonder.
JHN|7|22||Because Moses gave you circumcision, not that it was from Moses, but it was from the fathers, ye circumcise a child on the sabbath.
JHN|7|23||And if a child is circumcised on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be violated, do ye murmur at me, because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?
JHN|7|24||Judge not, with a respect for persons; but judge ye a righteous judgment.
JHN|7|25||And some from Jerusalem said: Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
JHN|7|26||And lo, he discourseth publicly, and they say nothing to him. Do our Elders know, that he really is the Messiah?
JHN|7|27||Yet we know this man, whence he is; the Messiah, when he shall come, no one knoweth whence he is.
JHN|7|28||And Jesus, while teaching in the temple, raised his voice and said: Ye both know me, and ye know from whence I am. And I did not come of my own accord; but he that sent me is true. Him ye know not;
JHN|7|29||but I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
JHN|7|30||And they sought to apprehend him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
JHN|7|31||And many of the multitude believed on him, and said: When the Messiah cometh, will he work greater signs than these which this man doeth?
JHN|7|32||And the Pharisees heard the multitude say these things of him: and they and the chief priests sent constables to take him.
JHN|7|33||And Jesus said: A little while longer I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me.
JHN|7|34||And ye will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come.
JHN|7|35||The Jews said among themselves: Whither is he about to go, that we cannot find him? Will he go to some region of the Gentiles, and teach the profane?
JHN|7|36||What means this speech he uttered: Ye will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
JHN|7|37||And on the great day, which was the last of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, and said: If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.
JHN|7|38||Whoever believeth in me, as the scriptures have said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.
JHN|7|39||This he said of the Spirit, which they who believe in him were to receive: for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
JHN|7|40||And many of the multitude who heard his discourses, said: Certainly, he is a prophet.
JHN|7|41||Others said: He is the Messiah. Others said: Doth Messiah come from Galilee?
JHN|7|42||Doth not the scriptures say, That Messiah cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town of David?
JHN|7|43||And there was a division among the multitude respecting him.
JHN|7|44||And there were some of them who wished to apprehend him. But no one laid hands on him.
JHN|7|45||And the constables came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and the priests said to them: Why have ye not brought him?
JHN|7|46||The constables say to them: Never did a man speak, as this man speaketh.
JHN|7|47||The Pharisees said to them: Are ye also deceived?
JHN|7|48||Have any of the chiefs, or of the Pharisees, believed in him?
JHN|7|49||But this people, who know not the law, are accursed.
JHN|7|50||One of them: Nicodemus, he who came to Jesus by night, said to them:
JHN|7|51||Doth our law condemn a man, unless it first hear him, and know what he hath done?
JHN|7|52||They answered, and said to him: Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and see, that no prophet ariseth from Galilee.
JHN|7|53||So they went every one to his own house.*
JHN|8|1||And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
JHN|8|2||And in the morning he came again to the temple; and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
JHN|8|3||And the Scribes and Pharisees brought forward a woman that was caught in adultery. And when they had placed her in the midst,
JHN|8|4||they say to him: Teacher, this woman was caught openly in the act of adultery.
JHN|8|5||And in the law of Moses, [God] hath commanded us to stone such persons. What therefore dost thou say?
JHN|8|6||And this they said, tempting him, so that they might have [ground] to accuse him. But Jesus having stooped down, was writing on the ground.
JHN|8|7||And as they continued asking him, he straightened himself up, and said to them: Whoever among you is without sin, let him first cast a stone at her.
JHN|8|8||And, having again stooped down, he wrote on the ground.
JHN|8|9||And they, when they heard [it], went out one by one, beginning with the older; and the woman was left, alone where she had stood in the midst.
JHN|8|10||And when Jesus had straightened himself up, he said to the woman: Where are they? Doth no one condemn thee?
JHN|8|11||And she said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither do I condemn thee. Go thou, and henceforth sin no more.
JHN|8|12||And Jesus again conversed with them, and said: I am the light of the world: he that cometh to me, will not walk in darkness; but will find for himself the light of life.
JHN|8|13||The Pharisees said to him: Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy testimony is not certain.
JHN|8|14||Jesus answered and said to them: Although I bear witness of myself, my testimony is certain, because I know whence I came, and whither I go. But ye do not know, whence I came, and whither I go.
JHN|8|15||Ye judge according to the flesh: I judge no one.
JHN|8|16||Yet if I judge, my judgment is certain, because I am not alone, but I and my Father who sent me.
JHN|8|17||And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two persons is certain.
JHN|8|18||I am one: who bear witness of myself, and my Father who sent me, beareth witness of me.
JHN|8|19||They say to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus replied, and said to them: Ye neither know me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would also have known my Father.
JHN|8|20||These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no one laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
JHN|8|21||Again Jesus said to them: I go away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins. And whither I go, ye cannot come.
JHN|8|22||The Jews said: Is he about to kill himself, that he should say, Whither I go ye cannot come?
JHN|8|23||And he said to them: Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world
JHN|8|24||I said to you, That ye will die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye will die in your sins.
JHN|8|25||The Jews said to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: Although I have begun to converse with you,
JHN|8|26||I have yet many things to say and to Judge concerning you. But he that sent me is true: and the things which I have heard from him, them I speak in the world.
JHN|8|27||And they did not know, that he spake to them of the Father.
JHN|8|28||Jesus said to them again: When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then will ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing from my own pleasure, but as my Father taught me, so I speak.
JHN|8|29||And he that sent me, is with me; and my Father hath not left me alone, because I do, at all times, that which pleaseth him.
JHN|8|30||And when he had spoken these things, many believed on him.
JHN|8|31||And Jesus said to those Jews who believed on him: If ye continue in my word, ye will be truly my disciples.
JHN|8|32||And ye will know the truth; and the truth will make you free.
JHN|8|33||They say to him: We are the seed of Abraham, and never were in servitude to any man; and how sayest thou, Ye will be freemen?
JHN|8|34||Jesus said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you, That whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.
JHN|8|35||And a servant abideth not for ever in the house; but the Son abideth for ever.
JHN|8|36||If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye will really be free men.
JHN|8|37||I know that ye are the children of Abraham; but ye seek to kill me, because ye do not acquiesce in my word.
JHN|8|38||I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
JHN|8|39||They answered, and said to him: Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them: If ye were children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.
JHN|8|40||But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.
JHN|8|41||But ye do the works of your father. They say to him: We are not [the offspring] of whoredom; we have one Father, God.
JHN|8|42||Jesus said to them: If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded and came from God: I did not come of my own accord, but he sent me.
JHN|8|43||Why do ye not understand my speech? It is because ye cannot hear my speech.
JHN|8|44||Ye are of your father, the calumniator; and the lust of your father ye are disposed to do. He was from the beginning a manslayer, and abode not in the truth; for the truth is not in him, and when he speaketh a lie he speaketh from himself, for he is a liar, and the father of it.
JHN|8|45||But me, because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.
JHN|8|46||Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?
JHN|8|47||He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore ye do not hear, because ye are not of God.
JHN|8|48||The Jews answered, and said to him: Did we not well say, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
JHN|8|49||Jesus said to them: I have no demon: but I honor God; and ye contemn me.
JHN|8|50||But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh [it], and judgeth.
JHN|8|51||Verily, verily, I say to you: He that keepeth my word, will never see death.
JHN|8|52||The Jews say to him: Now we know, that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; yet thou sayest: He that keepeth my word, will never taste death.
JHN|8|53||Art thou greater than our father Abraham who is dead, or than the prophets who died? What dost thou make thyself?
JHN|8|54||Jesus said to them: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say, He is our God.
JHN|8|55||And ye know him not. But I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar, like you: but I do know him, and I observe his word.
JHN|8|56||Abraham your father desired to see my day: and he saw it, and rejoiced.
JHN|8|57||The Jews say to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
JHN|8|58||Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, That before Abraham existed, I was.
JHN|8|59||And they took up stones to stone him. But Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, and passed along among them, and went away.
JHN|9|1||And while passing, he saw a man blind from his mother's womb.
JHN|9|2||And his disciples asked him, and said: Our Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
JHN|9|3||Jesus said to them: Neither did he sin, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be seen in him.
JHN|9|4||I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night cometh, in which no one can work.
JHN|9|5||So long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
JHN|9|6||And having spoken thus, he spit on the ground, and made mud with the spittle, and spread it on the eyes of the blind man;
JHN|9|7||and said to him: Go, wash in the baptistery of Siloam. And he went, and washed, and came away seeing.
JHN|9|8||And his neighbors, and they by whom he had before been seen begging, said: Is not this he, who sat and begged?
JHN|9|9||Some said, It is he: and others said, No; but he is very like him. But he said: I am he.
JHN|9|10||And they said to him: How were thy eyes opened?
JHN|9|11||He answered, and said to them: A man whose name is Jesus, made mud and spread it on my eyes, and said to me, Go, wash in the waters of Siloam. And I went, and washed, and my sight was restored.
JHN|9|12||They said to him: Where is he? He said to them: I know not.
JHN|9|13||And they brought him that had been blind, before the Pharisees.
JHN|9|14||Now it was on the sabbath that Jesus made the mud, and opened his eyes.
JHN|9|15||And again the Pharisees asked him: How was thy sight restored? And he said to them: He put mud upon my eyes, and I washed, and my sight was restored.
JHN|9|16||And some of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, for he doth not observe the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner, work these signs? And there was a division among them.
JHN|9|17||They say again to the blind man: What sayest thou of him, seeing he hath opened thy eyes? He said to them: I say, that he is a prophet.
JHN|9|18||And the Jews would not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and recovered sight, until they called the parents of him who recovered sight.
JHN|9|19||And they asked them: Is this your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind? And how doth he now see?
JHN|9|20||And his parents answered and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
JHN|9|21||but how he now seeth, or who opened his eyes, we know not. He hath come to his years, ask him; he will speak for himself.
JHN|9|22||These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had decided, that if any one should confess him to be Messiah, they would expel him from the synagogue.
JHN|9|23||For this reason his parents said, He hath come to his years, ask him.
JHN|9|24||And they called a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; for we know that this man is a sinner.
JHN|9|25||He replied, and said to them: Whether he is a sinner, I know not; but, one thing I know, that I was blind, and lo, now I see.
JHN|9|26||They said to him again: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?
JHN|9|27||He said to them: I have told you, and ye did not hear. Why would ye hear again? Do ye also wish to become his disciples?
JHN|9|28||But they reproached him, and said to him: Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses.
JHN|9|29||And we know that God conversed with Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
JHN|9|30||The man replied and said to them: In this therefore is [something] to be admired, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened my eyes.
JHN|9|31||Now we know, that God heareth not the voice of sinners; but him that feareth him, and doeth his pleasure, him he heareth.
JHN|9|32||Never hath it been heard, that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.
JHN|9|33||If this man were not of God, he could not do this thing.
JHN|9|34||They replied, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins; and dost thou teach us? And they expelled him.
JHN|9|35||And Jesus heard that they had expelled him; and he found him, and said to him: Believest thou on the Son of God?
JHN|9|36||And he that was healed, answered and said: My Lord, who is he, that I may believe on him?
JHN|9|37||Jesus said to him: Thou hast seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
JHN|9|38||And he said: My Lord, I believe: and he fell down, and worshipped him.
JHN|9|39||And Jesus said: For the judgment of this world, have I come; that they who see not, might see; and that they who see, might become blind.
JHN|9|40||And [some] of those Pharisees who were with him, heard these things; and they said to him: How? Are we also blind?
JHN|9|41||Jesus said to them: If ye were blind, ye would be without sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin is established.
JHN|10|1||Verily, verily, I say to you, That he who doth not enter by the door into the fold of the flock, but climbeth up in some other place, he is a thief and a robber.
JHN|10|2||But he that entereth by the door, is the shepherd of the flock.
JHN|10|3||And to him the door-keeper openeth the door; and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth the sheep by their names, and leadeth them out.
JHN|10|4||And when he hath led out his flock, he goeth before it; and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
JHN|10|5||But after a stranger the flock will not follow, but it fleeth from him; because it knoweth not the voice of a stranger.
JHN|10|6||This allegory spake Jesus to them; but they knew not what he said to them.
JHN|10|7||And Jesus said to them again: Verily, verily, I say to you, That I am the door of the flock.
JHN|10|8||All those who have come, were thieves and robbers: but the flock did not hear them.
JHN|10|9||I am the door: and if any enter by me, he will live, and will come in and go out, and will find pasture.
JHN|10|10||The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy. I have come, that they may have life, and may have that which is excellent.
JHN|10|11||I am a good shepherd. A good shepherd exposeth his life for the sheep.
JHN|10|12||But a hireling, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, when he seeth the wolf coming, leaveth the flock, and fleeth; and the wolf cometh, and teareth, and disperseth the flock.
JHN|10|13||And a hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and hath no concern for the flock.
JHN|10|14||I am a good shepherd; and I know my own [sheep], and am known by my own.
JHN|10|15||As my Father knoweth me, so know I my Father; and I expose my life for the flock.
JHN|10|16||And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: and them also I must bring; and they will hear my voice; and the whole will be one flock, and one shepherd.
JHN|10|17||For this cause my Father loveth me, that I lay down my life, to resume it again.
JHN|10|18||There is no one that taketh it from me; but I lay it down of my own pleasure: for I have authority to lay it down, and authority to resume it again; because I have received this command from my Father.
JHN|10|19||And again there was a division among the Jews, on account of these sayings.
JHN|10|20||And many of them said: He hath a demon, and is wholly beside himself; why hear ye him?
JHN|10|21||But others said: These are not the discourses of a demoniac: can a demon open the eyes of one blind?
JHN|10|22||And the feast of the dedication was [held] at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
JHN|10|23||And Jesus walked in the temple, in the porch of Solomon.
JHN|10|24||And the Jews gathered around him; and said to him: how long holdest thou our mind in suspense? If thou art the Messiah, tell us plainly.
JHN|10|25||Jesus answered, and said to them: I have told you, and ye did not believe. The works which I do in the name of my Father, they testify of me
JHN|10|26||But ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep, as I have said to you.
JHN|10|27||My sheep hear my voice: and I know them: and they go after me.
JHN|10|28||And I give to them life eternal: and they will never be lost: nor will any one pluck them from my hand.
JHN|10|29||For my Father, who gave [them] to me, is greater than all; nor can any pluck from my Father's hand.
JHN|10|30||I and my Father are one.
JHN|10|31||And again the Jews took up stones, to stone him.
JHN|10|32||Jesus said to them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
JHN|10|33||The Jews said to him: It is not on account of good works, that we stone thee: but because thou blasphemest; and, whilst thou art a man, thou makest thyself God.
JHN|10|34||Jesus said to them: Is it not written in your law, I have said, Ye are gods?
JHN|10|35||If he called them gods, because the word of God was with them, and the scripture cannot be nullified;
JHN|10|36||do ye say to him, whom the Father, hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said to you, I am the Son of God?
JHN|10|37||And if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
JHN|10|38||But if I do [them], although ye believe not me, yet believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that my Father is in me, and I in my Father.
JHN|10|39||And again they sought to lay hold of him; but he escaped out of their hands;
JHN|10|40||and retired to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John at first baptized, and tarried there.
JHN|10|41||And many persons came to him: and they said, John indeed wrought not even one sign; but every thing that John said of his man, was true.
JHN|10|42||And many believed on him.
JHN|11|1||And a certain man was sick, Lazarus of the town of Bethany, the brother of Mary and Martha.
JHN|11|2||It was that Mary who anointed the feet of Jesus with perfume, and wiped [them] with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
JHN|11|3||And his two sisters sent to Jesus, and said: Our Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.
JHN|11|4||And Jesus said: This sickness is not that of death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.
JHN|11|5||Now Jesus loved Martha and Mary, and Lazarus.
JHN|11|6||And when he heard that he was sick, he remained in the place where he was two days.
JHN|11|7||And afterwards he said to his disciples: Come, let us go again into Judaea.
JHN|11|8||His disciples say to him: Our Rabbi, the Jews have just sought to stone thee; and goest thou again thither.
JHN|11|9||Jesus said to them: Are there not twelve hours in the day? And if a man walk in the daytime, he stumbleth not; because he seeth the light of the world.
JHN|11|10||But if one walk in the night, he stumbleth; because there is no light in him.
JHN|11|11||These things said Jesus, and afterwards he said to them: Lazarus our friend reposeth. But I go to awake him.
JHN|11|12||His disciples say to him: Our Lord, if he sleepeth, he is recovering.
JHN|11|13||But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought, he spoke of the sleep of repose.
JHN|11|14||Then Jesus said to them explicitly; Lazarus is dead.
JHN|11|15||And I rejoice, for your sakes, that I was not there; that ye may believe. But let us go there.
JHN|11|16||Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow-disciples: Let us also go [and] die with him.
JHN|11|17||And Jesus came to Bethany, and found that he had been in the grave four days.
JHN|11|18||Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, distant from it about fifteen furlongs.
JHN|11|19||And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
JHN|11|20||And Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet him; but Mary was sitting in the house.
JHN|11|21||And Martha said to Jesus: My Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
JHN|11|22||But even now, I know, that whatever thou wilt ask of God, he will give it thee.
JHN|11|23||Jesus said to her: Thy brother will rise.
JHN|11|24||Martha said to him: I know, that he will rise in the consolation, at the last day.
JHN|11|25||Jesus said to her: I am the consolation, and life. And he that believeth in me, though he should die, will live.
JHN|11|26||And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, will not die for ever. Believest thou this?
JHN|11|27||She said to him: Yes, my Lord; I believe, that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, that cometh into the world.
JHN|11|28||And when she had thus said, she went and called her sister Mary, secretly, and said to her: Our Rabbi hath come, and calleth for thee.
JHN|11|29||And Mary, when she heard [it], rose up quickly, and went to meet him.
JHN|11|30||And Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
JHN|11|31||Those Jews also, who were with her in the house and consoled her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed after her; for they supposed, she was going to the grave to weep.
JHN|11|32||And Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, and said to him: If thou hadst been here, my Lord, my brother had not died.
JHN|11|33||And when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he was moved in spirit, and was agitated.
JHN|11|34||And he said: Where have ye laid him? They say to him: Our Lord, come, and see.
JHN|11|35||And the tears of Jesus came.
JHN|11|36||And the Jews said: See, how much he loved him.
JHN|11|37||And some of them said: Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man, have caused that this also should not have died?
JHN|11|38||And Jesus, still agitated within, came to the grave. Now the grave was a cave, and a stone was laid upon its entrance.
JHN|11|39||And Jesus said: Take away this stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: My Lord, by this time he is putrid; for four days have elapsed.
JHN|11|40||Jesus said to her: Did I not tell thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?
JHN|11|41||And they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes on high, and said: Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
JHN|11|42||And I know that thou hearest me always; but on account of this multitude that standeth here, I say these things; that they may believe, that thou hast sent me.
JHN|11|43||And when he had thus spoken, he called with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth!
JHN|11|44||And the dead man came forth, with his hands and his feet swathed with bandages, and his face with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
JHN|11|45||And many of the Jews who had come to Mary, when they saw what Jesus did, believed on him.
JHN|11|46||But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them all that Jesus had done.
JHN|11|47||And the chief priests and Pharisees assembled together, and said: What shall we do? For this man worketh many signs.
JHN|11|48||And if we thus let him alone, all the people will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away our place and our nation.
JHN|11|49||But, one of them, named Caiaphas, was the high priest of that year; and he said to them: Ye know not any thing.
JHN|11|50||Neither do ye consider, that it is expedient for us, that one man die for the people, and not that this whole people perish.
JHN|11|51||This he said, however, not from the promptings of his own mind; but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied, that Jesus was about to die for the people:
JHN|11|52||and not only for the people, but also that he might collect together the sons of God that were dispersed.
JHN|11|53||And from that day, they plotted to kill him.
JHN|11|54||And Jesus did not walk openly among the Jews; but retired from them to a place near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he abode with his disciples.
JHN|11|55||And the passover of the Jews drew near: and many went up from the villages to Jerusalem, before the feast, that they might purify themselves.
JHN|11|56||And they sought for Jesus; and they said one to another, in the temple: What think ye? that he will not come to the feast?
JHN|11|57||And the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if any one knew where he was, he should make it known to them, that they might take him.
JHN|12|1||And six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where was that Lazarus whom Jesus raised from the dead.
JHN|12|2||And they made a supper for him there: and Martha served, and Lazarus was one of the guests with him.
JHN|12|3||And Mary took an alabaster box of perfume of choice spikenard, of great price; and anointed the feet of Jesus; and she wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the perfume.
JHN|12|4||Then said Judas Iscariot, one of the disciples, he that was about to betray him:
JHN|12|5||Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
JHN|12|6||And this he said, not be cause he cared for the poor, but because he was thief, and held the purse, and carried what was put in it.
JHN|12|7||But Jesus said: Let her alone; she hath kept it for the day of my burial.
JHN|12|8||For the poor are always with you, but I am not with you always.
JHN|12|9||And great multitudes of the Jews heard that he was there: and they came, not only on account of Jesus, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead.
JHN|12|10||And the chief priests deliberated about killing even Lazarus:
JHN|12|11||because many of the Jews, on his account, went and believed in Jesus.
JHN|12|12||And the next day, a great multitude who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
JHN|12|13||took boughs of palm-trees, and went out to meet him. And they cried, and said: Hosanna, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!
JHN|12|14||And Jesus found an ass, and sat upon it; as it is written
JHN|12|15||Fear not, daughter of Sion. Behold, thy king cometh to thee; and he rideth upon a colt, the foal of an ass.
JHN|12|16||These things understood not his disciples, at that time; but when Jesus was glorified, then his disciples remembered that these things were written of him, and that they did them to him.
JHN|12|17||And the multitude that had been with him, testified that he had called Lazarus from the grave, and raised him from the dead.
JHN|12|18||And for this reason, great multitudes went out to meet him, as they had heard that he wrought this sign.
JHN|12|19||But the Pharisees said, one to another: Do ye see, that ye are gaining nothing? For, lo, the whole world is going after him.
JHN|12|20||And there were also among the people, some who had come up to worship at the feast.
JHN|12|21||These came, and approached Philip, who was of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him: My lord, we are desirous to see Jesus.
JHN|12|22||Philip came and told Andrew; and Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
JHN|12|23||And Jesus answered, and said to them: The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.
JHN|12|24||Verily, verily, I say to you, That a kernel of wheat, unless it fall and die in the ground, remaineth alone; but if it die, it produceth numerous fruits.
JHN|12|25||He that loveth his life, will lose it; and he that hateth his life, in this world, will preserve it unto life everlasting.
JHN|12|26||If any one is servant to me, he will come after me; and where I am, there also will my servant be. Him that serveth me, will the Father honor.
JHN|12|27||Behold, now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? My Father, deliver me from this hour? But for this very cause, came I to this hour.
JHN|12|28||Father, glorify thy name! And a voice was heard from heaven: I have glorified [it]; and I will glorify [it] again.
JHN|12|29||And the multitude standing by, heard [it]; and they said: There was thunder. But others said: An angel spoke with him.
JHN|12|30||Jesus answered, and said to them: This voice was not for my sake, but for yours.
JHN|12|31||Now is the judgment of this world: now the ruler of this world is cast out.
JHN|12|32||And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.
JHN|12|33||And this he said, to show by what manner of death, he was to die.
JHN|12|34||The multitude said to him: We have heard from the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: [and] how sayest thou, that the Son of man is to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
JHN|12|35||Jesus said to them: A short time longer, the light is with you. Walk, while ye have the light, lest the darkness overtake you. He that walketh in the dark, knoweth not whither he goeth.
JHN|12|36||While the light is with you, confide in the light; that ye may be children of the light. These things said Jesus, and departed, and concealed himself from them.
JHN|12|37||And although he wrought all these signs before them, they believed him not;
JHN|12|38||that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, who said: My Lord; who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
JHN|12|39||For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
JHN|12|40||They have blinded their eyes, and darkened their hearts; that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted; and I should heal them.
JHN|12|41||These things spake Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
JHN|12|42||And of the chiefs also, many believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees, they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
JHN|12|43||for they loved the praise of men, more than the praise of God.
JHN|12|44||And Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent me.
JHN|12|45||And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
JHN|12|46||I have come into the world, a light, that whoever believeth in me, might not abide in darkness.
JHN|12|47||And whoever shall hear my words, and not observe them, I judge him not; for I did not come to judge the world, but to vivify the world.
JHN|12|48||Whoever rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, there is one to judge him; the word which I speak, will judge him, at the last day.
JHN|12|49||For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should speak, and what I should say.
JHN|12|50||And I know that his commandment is life eternal. Therefore, these things which I speak, as my Father hath said to me, so I speak.
JHN|13|1||And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the hour had come when he should depart from this world unto the Father. And he loved his own [people], who were in the world; and he loved them unto the end.
JHN|13|2||And when the supper was passed, it had been injected by Satan into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him.
JHN|13|3||And Jesus, because he knew that the Father had given all things into his hands; and that he came out from the Father, and was going to God;
JHN|13|4||arose from the supper, and laid aside his long garments, and took a linen cloth, and wrapped it about his loins;
JHN|13|5||and poured water into a wash-basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples: and he wiped them with the linen cloth with which he had girded his loins.
JHN|13|6||And when he came to Simon Cephas, Simon said to him: Dost thou, my Lord, wash my feet for me?
JHN|13|7||Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do, thou understandest not now: but hereafter thou wilt understand.
JHN|13|8||Simon Cephas said to him: Never shalt thou wash my feet. Jesus said to him: Unless I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
JHN|13|9||Simon Cephas said to him: Then, my Lord, not my feet only shalt thou wash, but also my hands and my head.
JHN|13|10||Jesus said to him: He that hath bathed, needeth not but to wash his feet; for he is all clean. And ye also are clean; but not all of you.
JHN|13|11||For Jesus knew, who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.
JHN|13|12||And when he had washed their feet, he resumed his long garments, and reclined. And he said to them: Understand ye what I have done to you?
JHN|13|13||Ye call me, Our Rabbi, and Our Lord; and ye speak well; for I am so.
JHN|13|14||If then I, your Lord and your Rabbi, have washed your feet, how much more ought ye to wash the feet of one another?
JHN|13|15||For I have given you this example, that ye might do, as I have done to you.
JHN|13|16||Verily, verily, I say to you, That no servant is greater than his lord; and no legate is greater than he who sent him.
JHN|13|17||If ye know these things, happy will ye be if ye do them.
JHN|13|18||Not of you all, do I speak: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted his heel against me.
JHN|13|19||From this time, I tell you, before it occurs, that when it shall occur, ye may know that I am he.
JHN|13|20||Verily, verily, I say to you: He that receiveth him whom I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
JHN|13|21||These things said Jesus, and he was agitated in his spirit; and he testified, and said: Verily, verily, I say to you, That one of you will betray me.
JHN|13|22||And the disciples stared at one another; because they knew not, of whom he spake.
JHN|13|23||And there was one of his disciples, who was reclining on his bosom, he whom Jesus loved;
JHN|13|24||to him Simon Cephas beckoned, that he should ask him, who it was of whom he spoke.
JHN|13|25||And that disciple fell upon the breast of Jesus, and said to him: My Lord, which is he?
JHN|13|26||Jesus answered and said: He it is, to whom I give the bread when I have dipped it. And Jesus dipped the bread, and gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
JHN|13|27||And after the bread, then Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: What thou doest, do quickly.
JHN|13|28||And no one of those reclining, knew, wherefore he said this to him.
JHN|13|29||For some of them supposed, because the purse was in the hands of Judas, that Jesus expressly charged him to buy something needful for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.
JHN|13|30||And Judas took the bread at once, and went out of the house. And it was night when he went out.
JHN|13|31||And Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified; and God is glorified in him.
JHN|13|32||And if God is glorified in him, God will glorify him in himself; and will glorify him speedily.
JHN|13|33||My children, a little longer I am with you; and ye will seek for me; and, as I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come, so I now say to you.
JHN|13|34||A new commandment I give to you, that ye be affectionate to each other. As I have loved you, do ye also love one another.
JHN|13|35||By this will every one know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love for each other.
JHN|13|36||Simon Cephas said to him: Our Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, and said to him: Whither I go, thou canst not now come after me; but thou wilt at last come.
JHN|13|37||Simon Cephas said to him: My Lord, why can I not come after thee? I would lay down my life for thee.
JHN|13|38||Jesus said to him: Wouldst thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock will not crow, until thou hast three times denied me.
JHN|14|1||Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and, believe in me.
JHN|14|2||There are many mansions in the house of my Father: and if not, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
JHN|14|3||And if I go to prepare for you a place, I will come again and take you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
JHN|14|4||And whither I go, ye know; and the way ye know.
JHN|14|5||Thomas said to him: Our Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
JHN|14|6||Jesus said to him: I am the way, and truth, and life: no one cometh unto my Father, but by me.
JHN|14|7||If ye had known me, ye would also have known my Father: and henceforth, ye know him, and have seen him.
JHN|14|8||Philip said to him: Our Lord, show us the Father, and it will suffice for us.
JHN|14|9||Jesus said to him: Have I been all this time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He that seeth me, seeth the Father: and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
JHN|14|10||Believest thou not, that I am in my Father, and my Father in me? And the words which I speak, I speak not from myself: but my Father, who dwelleth in me, he doeth these works.
JHN|14|11||Believe, that I am in my Father, and my Father in me. And if not, believe, at least, on account of the works.
JHN|14|12||Verily, verily, I say to you: He that believeth in me, the works which I do, will he also do. And greater than these will he do, because I go unto my Father.
JHN|14|13||And what ye shall ask in my name, I will do for you; that the Father may be glorified in his Son.
JHN|14|14||And if ye shall ask of me, in my name, I will do [it].
JHN|14|15||If ye love me, keep my commands.
JHN|14|16||And I will ask of my Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
JHN|14|17||the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, and knoweth him not: but ye know him, because he abideth with you, and is in you.
JHN|14|18||I shall not leave you orphans: for I shall come to you in a little while.
JHN|14|19||And the world will not see me; but ye will see me. Because I live, ye will live also.
JHN|14|20||In that day ye will know, that I am in my Father; and that ye are in me, and I in you.
JHN|14|21||He, with whom are my commands, and who keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, will be loved by my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
JHN|14|22||Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: My Lord, how is it that thou art to manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
JHN|14|23||Jesus answered, and said to him: He that loveth me, observeth my instruction; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
JHN|14|24||But he that loveth me not, observeth not my instruction. And the instruction which ye hear, is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
JHN|14|25||These things have I said to you, while I was with you.
JHN|14|26||But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you every thing, and will remind you of all that I say to you.
JHN|14|27||Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. It is not as the world giveth, that I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor be afraid.
JHN|14|28||Ye have heard what I said to you that I go away, and come [again] to you. If ye had loved me, ye would have rejoiced, that I go to my Father; for my Father is greater than I.
JHN|14|29||And now, lo, I have told you, before it occurreth; so that when it shall have occurred, ye may believe.
JHN|14|30||Hereafter I shall not converse much with you; for the ruler of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
JHN|14|31||But that the world may know, that I love my Father, and as my Father commanded me, so I do. Arise; let us go hence.
JHN|15|1||I am the true vine; and my Father is the cultivator.
JHN|15|2||Every branch in me, which yieldeth not fruits, he taketh it away: and that which yieldeth fruits, he cleanseth it, that it may yield more fruits.
JHN|15|3||Ye henceforth are clean, on account of the discourse I have held with you .
JHN|15|4||Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot yield fruits of itself, unless it abide in the vine; so also, neither can ye, unless ye abide in me.
JHN|15|5||I am the vine, and ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, he yieldeth much fruit; for without me, ye can do nothing.
JHN|15|6||And if a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a withered branch; and they gather it up, and cast it into the fire to be burned.
JHN|15|7||But if ye shall abide in me, and my instructions shall abide in you, whatever ye shall be pleased to ask, it will be given to you.
JHN|15|8||In this is the Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and ye will be my disciples.
JHN|15|9||As my Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in the love of me.
JHN|15|10||If ye shall keep my commands, ye will abide in the love of me, as I have kept the commands of my Father, and abide in his love.
JHN|15|11||These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.
JHN|15|12||This is my command, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.
JHN|15|13||There is no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
JHN|15|14||Ye are my friends, if ye do all that I command you.
JHN|15|15||I no longer call you servants; because a servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you my friends; because, whatever I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
JHN|15|16||It is not ye that chose me, but I that have chosen you; and I have appointed you, that ye also should go and yield fruits, and that your fruits should continue; so that whatever ye may ask of my Father in my name, he may give it you.
JHN|15|17||These things I command you, that ye should love one another.
JHN|15|18||And if the world hate you, know ye, that it hated me before you.
JHN|15|19||And if ye were of the world, the world would love what is of it. But ye are not of the world, for I have chosen you out of the world; for this cause, the world hateth you.
JHN|15|20||Remember the word that I spoke to you, That there is no servant, who is greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; and if they have observed my teaching, they will also observe yours.
JHN|15|21||But all these things will they do to you, on account of my name, because they know not him that sent me.
JHN|15|22||If I had not come and discoursed with them, sin would not have been to them; but now there is no excuse for their sins.
JHN|15|23||He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
JHN|15|24||If I had not wrought before them works which no other person ever did, sin would not have been to them: but now they have seen, and have hated, both me and my Father;
JHN|15|25||so that in them will be fulfilled the word which is written in their law: They hated me, without a cause.
JHN|15|26||But when the Comforter shall come, whom I will send to you from my Father, that Spirit of truth who proceedeth from the Father, He will testify of me.
JHN|15|27||And do ye also testify; for ye have been with me from the beginning.
JHN|16|1||. These things have I said to you, that ye may not be stumbled.
JHN|16|2||For they will eject you from their synagogues; and the hour will come, that whoever shall kill you, will suppose that he presenteth an offering to God.
JHN|16|3||And these things will they do, because they have not known either my Father, or me.
JHN|16|4||These things have I spoken to you, that when the time of them cometh, ye may recollect, that I told you of them. And I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
JHN|16|5||But now, I am going to Him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
JHN|16|6||And because I have told you these things, sorrow hath come and hath filled your hearts.
JHN|16|7||But I tell you the truth, that it is profitable for you that I go away; for, if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
JHN|16|8||And when he is come, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
JHN|16|9||Of sin because they believe not in me:
JHN|16|10||and of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more:
JHN|16|11||and of Judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
JHN|16|12||Moreover, I have much to say to you: but ye cannot comprehend [it] now.
JHN|16|13||But when the Spirit of truth shall come, he will lead you into all the truth. For he will not speak from his own mind; but whatever he heareth, that will he speak: and he will make known to you things to come.
JHN|16|14||He will glorify me; because he will receive of what is mine, and will show [it] to you.
JHN|16|15||Whatever the Father hath, is mine: therefore said I to you that he will receive of what is mine, and will show [it] to you.
JHN|16|16||A little while, and ye will not see me; and again a little while, and ye will see me; because I go to the Father.
JHN|16|17||And his disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye will not see me and again a little while, and ye will see me, because I go to my Father?
JHN|16|18||And they said: What is this little while, of which he speaketh? We know not what he saith.
JHN|16|19||And Jesus knew, that they desired to ask him; and he said to them: Are ye debating with each other, of what I said to you, A little while, and ye will not see me, and again a little while, and ye will see me?
JHN|16|20||Verily, verily, I say to you, That ye will weep and lament: And the world will rejoice, while to you will be sorrow. But your sorrow will be turned to joy.
JHN|16|21||A woman, in bringing forth, hath sorrow, for the day of her travail hath come: but when she hath brought forth a son, she remembereth not her anguish, because of the joy that a human being is born into the world.
JHN|16|22||Ye also now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will deprive you of your joy.
JHN|16|23||And in that day ye will ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say to you, That whatsoever ye shall ask of my Father in my name, he will give to you.
JHN|16|24||Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye will receive; that your joy may be complete.
JHN|16|25||These things have I spoken to you in allegories: but the hour will come, when I shall not speak to you in allegories, but I will speak to you plainly of the Father.
JHN|16|26||In that day ye will ask in my name; and I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you;
JHN|16|27||for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I proceeded from the presence of the Father.
JHN|16|28||I proceeded forth from before the Father, and came into the world; and again I leave the world, and go to the Father.
JHN|16|29||His disciples say to him: Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and thou utterest no allegory.
JHN|16|30||Now know we, that thou knowest every thing; and thou hast no need, that any one should ask thee: by this we believe, that thou didst proceed from God.
JHN|16|31||Jesus said to them: Do ye believe?
JHN|16|32||Behold, the hour cometh, and hath now come, when ye will be dispersed, each to his place; and ye will leave me alone. But I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
JHN|16|33||These things have I said to you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye will have trouble: but, take courage, I have vanquished the world.
JHN|17|1||These things spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: My Father, the hour is come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.
JHN|17|2||As thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that he might give life eternal to as many as thou hast given him.
JHN|17|3||And this is life eternal, that they may know thee, that thou art the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Jesus Messiah.
JHN|17|4||I have glorified thee on the earth; the work which thou gavest me to do, I have finished.
JHN|17|5||And now, my Father, glorify thou me, with that glory which I had with thee before the world was.
JHN|17|6||I have made known thy name to the men, whom thou gavest me from the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
JHN|17|7||Now I have known, that whatever thou hast given me, was from thee.
JHN|17|8||For, the words thou gavest to me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known certainly, that I came from thy presence; and they have believed that thou didst send me.
JHN|17|9||And I pray for them; it is not for the world that I pray, but for them whom thou hast given me, for they are thine.
JHN|17|10||And all that is mine is thine, and what is thine is mine; and I am glorified in them.
JHN|17|11||Henceforth I am not in the world; but these are in the world, and I go to thee. Holy Father, keep them in that thy name, which thou hast given to me; that they may be one, as we are.
JHN|17|12||While I have been with them in the world, I have kept them in thy name. Those thou gavest me, have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.
JHN|17|13||But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that my joy may be complete in them.
JHN|17|14||I have given them thy word: and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN|17|15||I pray not, that thou wouldst take them out of the world, but that thou wouldst keep them from evil:
JHN|17|16||for they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN|17|17||Father, sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is the truth.
JHN|17|18||As thou didst send me into the world, so have I also sent them into the world.
JHN|17|19||And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.
JHN|17|20||And it is not for them only that I pray, but also for those who shall believe in me through their discourse;
JHN|17|21||that they all may be one; as thou, my Father, [art] in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; so that the world may believe, that thou didst send me.
JHN|17|22||And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, as we are one.
JHN|17|23||I in them, and thou in me; that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou didst send me, and that thou hast loved them as also thou hast loved me.
JHN|17|24||Father, I desire that those whom thou hast given me, may also be with me where I am; that they may see that glory of mine which thou hast given me, as thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
JHN|17|25||My righteous Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee, and these have known, that thou didst send me.
JHN|17|26||And I have made known to them thy name; and I will make it known; so that the love, with which thou lovedst me, may be in them, and I in them.
JHN|18|1||These things spake Jesus, and went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.
JHN|18|2||And Judas also, the betrayer, knew the place; because Jesus often there met with his disciples.
JHN|18|3||Then Judas received a regiment, and from the presence of the chief priests and Pharisees he had officials; and he came to the place with lanterns and lamps and weapons.
JHN|18|4||And Jesus, as he knew every thing that was to befall him, went forth and said to them: Whom seek ye?
JHN|18|5||They say to him: Jesus the Nazarean. Jesus said to them: I am he. And Judas the betrayer was also standing with them.
JHN|18|6||And when Jesus said to them, I am he, they drew back and fell upon the ground.
JHN|18|7||And again Jesus asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said: Jesus the Nazarean.
JHN|18|8||Jesus said to them: I have told you that I am he; and if ye seek me, let these go away:
JHN|18|9||that the speech might be fulfilled, which he uttered: Of them, whom thou hast given me, I have lost not even one.
JHN|18|10||And Simon Cephas had upon him a sword; and he drew it, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.
JHN|18|11||And Jesus said to Cephas: Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
JHN|18|12||Then the regiment and the chiliarchs and the officials of the Jews laid hold of Jesus, and bound him;
JHN|18|13||and they led him first to the presence of Annas; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest of that year.
JHN|18|14||And it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews, that it was expedient, one man should die for the people.
JHN|18|15||And Simon Cephas and one other of the disciples went after Jesus. And that other disciple knew the high priest; and he entered with Jesus into the hall.
JHN|18|16||But Simon stood without at the door; and that other disciple, who knew the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought in Simon.
JHN|18|17||And the maid who kept the door, said to Simon: Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? And he said: I am not.
JHN|18|18||And the servants and officials were standing, and had placed a fire to warm themselves
JHN|18|19||And the high priest interrogated Jesus respecting his disciples, and respecting his doctrine.
JHN|18|20||And Jesus said to him: I have discoursed openly with the people, and have at all times taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble; and I have uttered nothing in private.
JHN|18|21||Why dost thou interrogate me? Ask them who have heard, what I said to them: lo, they know what I have said.
JHN|18|22||And as he said these things, one of the officials standing by, smote the cheek of Jesus, and said to him: Givest thou such an answer to the high priest?
JHN|18|23||Jesus replied, and said to him: If I have spoken evil bear witness of that evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?
JHN|18|24||Now Annas had sent Jesus bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN|18|25||And Simon Cephas was standing and warming himself; and they said to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? And he denied, and said: I am not.
JHN|18|26||And one of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of him whose ear Simon cut off, said to him: Did I not see thee with him in the garden?
JHN|18|27||And again Simon denied: and at that moment the cock crew.
JHN|18|28||And they led Jesus from the presence of Caiaphas unto the Praetorium; and it was morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium, lest they should defile themselves before they had eaten the passover.
JHN|18|29||And Pilate went forth to them without, and said to them: What accusation have ye against this man?
JHN|18|30||They replied, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we should not have delivered him up to thee.
JHN|18|31||Pilate said to them: Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to put a man to death:
JHN|18|32||that the speech of Jesus might be fulfilled, when he made known by what death he was to die.
JHN|18|33||And Pilate went into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?
JHN|18|34||Jesus said to him: Sayest thou this of thyself, or have others said [it] to thee of me?
JHN|18|35||Pilate said to him: Am I a Jew? Thy countrymen and the chief priests have delivered thee to me. What hast thou done?
JHN|18|36||Jesus said to him: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews: but now, my kingdom is not from hence.
JHN|18|37||Pilate said to him . Then thou art a king? Jesus said to him: Thou hast said, that I am a king. For this was I born; and for this came I into the world, that I might bear testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.
JHN|18|38||Pilate said to him: What is the truth? And as he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them: I find not any crime in him.
JHN|18|39||And ye have a custom that I should release one to you at the passover; will ye, therefore, that I release to you this king of the Jews?
JHN|18|40||And they all cried out, and said: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now this Barabbas was a robber.
JHN|19|1||Then Pilate scourged Jesus.
JHN|19|2||And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns, and put it on his head; and they clothed him in purple garments:
JHN|19|3||and they said: Hail, king of the Jews! and smote him on his cheeks.
JHN|19|4||And Pilate went out again, and said to them: Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find against him no offence whatever.
JHN|19|5||And Jesus went forth, having on him the crown of thorns, and the purple garments. And Pilate said to them: Behold, the man!
JHN|19|6||And when the chief priests and officials saw him, they cried out, and said: Hang him; hang him. Pilate said to them: Take ye him, and crucify him; for I find no offence in him.
JHN|19|7||The Jews say to him: We have a law, and, according to our law, he deserveth death, because he made himself the Son of God.
JHN|19|8||And when Pilate heard that declaration, he feared the more.
JHN|19|9||And he went again into the Praetorium; and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him no answer.
JHN|19|10||Pilate said to him: Wilt thou not speak to me? Knowest thou not, that I have authority to release thee, and have authority to crucify thee?
JHN|19|11||Jesus said to him: Thou wouldst have no authority at all over me, if it were not given to thee from on high: therefore his sin who delivered me up to thee, is greater than thine.
JHN|19|12||And for this reason, Pilate was disposed to release him. But the Jews cried out: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: for whoever maketh himself a king, is the adversary of Caesar.
JHN|19|13||And when Pilate heard this declaration, he brought Jesus forth, and sat upon the tribunal, in a place called the pavement of stones; but in Hebrew it is called Gabbatha.
JHN|19|14||And it was the preparation for the passover; and it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: Behold, your king.
JHN|19|15||But they cried out: Away with him, away with him; hang him, hang him. Pilate said to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests said to him: We have no king, but Caesar.
JHN|19|16||Then he delivered him to them, that they might crucify him. And they took Jesus, and led him away,
JHN|19|17||bearing his cross, to a place called a Skull, and in Hebrew called Golgotha;
JHN|19|18||where they crucified him; and two others with him, the one on this side, and the other on that, and Jesus in the middle.
JHN|19|19||And Pilate also wrote a tablet, and affixed it to his cross. And thus it was written: THIS IS JESUS THE NAZAREAN, KING OF THE JEWS.
JHN|19|20||And many of the Jews read this label; because the place where Jesus was crucified, was near to Jerusalem; and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin.
JHN|19|21||And the chief priests said to Pilate: Write not that he is king of the Jews, but that he said I am king of the Jews.
JHN|19|22||Pilate said: What I have written, I have written.
JHN|19|23||And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parcels of them, a parcel for each of the soldiers. And his tunic was without seam from the top, woven throughout.
JHN|19|24||And they said one to another: We will not rend it, but will cast the lot upon it, whose it shall he. And the scripture was fulfilled, which said: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast the lot. These things did the soldiers.
JHN|19|25||And there were standing near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, and Mary [the wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalena.
JHN|19|26||And Jesus saw his mother, and that disciple whom he loved, standing by, and he said to his mother: Woman, behold, thy son.
JHN|19|27||And he said to that disciple: Behold, thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her near himself.
JHN|19|28||After these things, Jesus knew that every thing was finished; and, that the scripture might be fulfilled, he said: I thirst.
JHN|19|29||And a vessel was standing there, full of vinegar. And they filled a sponge with the vinegar, and put it on a hyssop [stalk], and bore it to his mouth.
JHN|19|30||And when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said: Lo; Done. And he bowed his head, and yielded up his spirit.
JHN|19|31||And because it was the preparation, the Jews said: These bodies must not remain all night upon the cross: because the sabbath was dawning; and the day of that sabbath was a great day. And they requested of Pilate, that they should break the legs of those crucified, and take them down.
JHN|19|32||And the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
JHN|19|33||But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead; and they broke not his legs.
JHN|19|34||But one of the soldiers thrust a spear into his side; and immediately there issued out blood and water.
JHN|19|35||And he who saw [it], hath testified: and his testimony is true: and he knoweth, that he speaketh the truth, that ye also may believe.
JHN|19|36||For these things occurred, that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said: A bone of him shall not be broken.
JHN|19|37||And again another scripture, which saith: They will look on him, whom they pierced.
JHN|19|38||After these things, Joseph of Ramath, for he was a disciple of Jesus, and kept concealed through fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted. And he came, and bore away the body of Jesus.
JHN|19|39||And there came also Nicodemus, he who previously came to Jesus by night, and he brought with him a compound of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
JHN|19|40||and they bore away the body of Jesus, and wound it in linens and aromatics, as it is the custom of the Jews to bury.
JHN|19|41||And there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new sepulchre in which no person had ever been laid.
JHN|19|42||And there they laid Jesus, because the sabbath had commenced, and because the sepulchre was near.
JHN|20|1||And the first day of the week, in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalena came to the sepulchre: and she saw that the stone was removed from the grave.
JHN|20|2||And she ran, and came to Simon Cephas, and to that other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them: They have taken away our Lord from the sepulchre, and I know not where they have laid him.
JHN|20|3||And Simon set out, and the other disciple, and they were going to the sepulchre.
JHN|20|4||And they both ran together; but that disciple outran Simon, and came first to the sepulchre.
JHN|20|5||And he looked in, and saw the linen cloths lying: but he did not go in.
JHN|20|6||And after him came Simon; and he entered the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying;
JHN|20|7||and the napkin, that had been wrapped about his head, was not with the linen cloths, but was folded up, and laid in a place by itself.
JHN|20|8||Then entered also the disciple who came first to the sepulchre; and he saw, and believed.
JHN|20|9||For they had not yet learned from the scriptures, that he was to arise from the dead.
JHN|20|10||And those disciples went away again to their place.
JHN|20|11||But Mary remained standing at the sepulchre, and weeping; and as she wept, she looked into the sepulchre
JHN|20|12||and saw two angels in white, who were sitting, one at the pillows and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was laid.
JHN|20|13||And they said to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She said to them: Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him
JHN|20|14||Having said this, she turned round, and saw Jesus standing, but did not know that it was Jesus.
JHN|20|15||Jesus said to her: Woman, why weepest thou? and, whom dost thou seek? And she supposed that he was the gardener: and she said to him: My lord, if thou hast borne him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, [and] I will go and take him away.
JHN|20|16||Jesus said to her: Mary! And she turned, and said to him in Hebrew: Rabbuni; which is interpreted Teacher.
JHN|20|17||Jesus said to her: Touch me not; for not yet have I ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
JHN|20|18||Then came Mary Magdalena, and told the disciples that she had seen our Lord; and that he had said these things to her.
JHN|20|19||And on the evening of that first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be with you.
JHN|20|20||Having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. And the disciples rejoiced, when they saw our Lord.
JHN|20|21||And Jesus said to them; Peace be with you. As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.
JHN|20|22||And as he said these things, he breathed on them, and said to them: Receive ye the Holy Spirit.
JHN|20|23||If ye shall remit sins to any one, they will be remitted to him; and if ye shall retain [those] of any one, they will be retained.
JHN|20|24||But Thomas, who was called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not there with them, when Jesus came.
JHN|20|25||And the disciples said to him: We have seen our Lord. But he said to them: Unless I see in his hands the places of the nails, and put my fingers into them, and extend my hand to his side, I will not believe.
JHN|20|26||And after eight days, the disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: and Jesus came, while the doors were closed, stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be with you.
JHN|20|27||And he said to Thomas: Reach hither thy finger, and look at my hands; and reach out thy hand and extend it to my side: and be not incredulous, but believing.
JHN|20|28||And Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God!
JHN|20|29||Jesus said to him: Now, when thou hast seen me, thou believest: blessed are they, who have not seen me, yet believe.
JHN|20|30||And many other signs did Jesus before his disciples, which are not written in this book.
JHN|20|31||But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and that when ye believe, ye may have life eternal by his name.
JHN|21|1||After these things, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias: and he showed himself thus:
JHN|21|2||There were together, Simon Cephas, and Thomas called the Twin, and Nathaniel who was of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of the disciples.
JHN|21|3||Simon Cephas said to them: I will go [and] catch fishes. They said to him: We will go with thee. And they went, and embarked in a ship: and that night, they caught nothing.
JHN|21|4||And when it was morning, Jesus stood on the shore of the sea: and the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
JHN|21|5||And Jesus said to them: Lads, have ye any thing to eat? They say to him: No.
JHN|21|6||He said to them: Cast your net on the right side of the ship, and ye will find them. And they cast; and they could not draw up the net, because of the multitude of fishes it contained.
JHN|21|7||And that disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Cephas: That is our Lord. And Simon, when he heard that it was our Lord, took his tunic, and girded his loins, for he had been naked, and threw himself into the sea, to go to Jesus.
JHN|21|8||But the other disciples came in the ship, for they were not very far from the land, only about two hundred cubits, and they dragged the net with the fishes.
JHN|21|9||And when they came upon the land, they saw coals placed, and fish laid on them, and bread.
JHN|21|10||And Jesus said to them: Bring [some] of the fishes, which ye have just caught.
JHN|21|11||And Simon Cephas embarked, and drew the net to land, full of huge fishes, one hundred and fifty and three. And with all this weight, the net was not rent.
JHN|21|12||And Jesus said to them: Come and dine. And no one of the disciples presumed to ask him, who he was; for they knew that it was our Lord.
JHN|21|13||And Jesus came, and took bread and fishes, and gave to his disciples.
JHN|21|14||This is the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples when he had arisen from the dead.
JHN|21|15||And when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Cephas: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me, more than these do? He said to him: Yes, my Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my lambs for me.
JHN|21|16||Again, he said to him the second time: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said to him: Yes, my Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep for me.
JHN|21|17||Again, Jesus said to him the third time: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? And it grieved Cephas, that he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me; and he said to him: My Lord, thou understandest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep for me.
JHN|21|18||Verily, verily, I say to thee: When thou wast young, thou girdedst thy own loins, and walkedst whither it pleased thee: but when thou shalt be old, thou wilt extend thy hands, and another will gird thy loins for thee, and will conduct thee whither thou wouldst not.
JHN|21|19||And this he said, to show by what death he was to glorify God. And having said these things, he said to him: Follow me.
JHN|21|20||And Simon turned himself, and saw coming after him, that disciple whom Jesus loved, who fell on the breast of Jesus at the supper, and said, My Lord, who is it will betray thee?
JHN|21|21||Him Cephas saw, and said to Jesus: My Lord, as for this man, what?
JHN|21|22||Jesus said to him: If I will, that he abide here until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.
JHN|21|23||And this saying went forth among the brethren, that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say, that he would not die; but, If I will that he abide here until I come, what [is that] to thee.
JHN|21|24||This is the disciple who hath testified of all these things, and hath written them: and we know, that his testimony is true.
JHN|21|25||And there are also many other things, which Jesus did; which, if written out with particularity, the world itself, as I suppose, would not suffice for the books that would be written.
ACT|1|1||The former book have I written, O Theophilus concerning all the things which our Lord Jesus Messiah began to do and teach,
ACT|1|2||until the day when he was taken up, after he had instructed those legates whom he had chosen by the Holy Spirit.
ACT|1|3||To whom also he showed himself alive after he had suffered, by numerous signs, during forty days, while he was seen by them, and spoke of the kingdom of God.
ACT|1|4||And when he had eaten bread with them, he instructed them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which (said he) ye have heard from me.
ACT|1|5||For John baptized with water; but ye will be baptized with the Holy Spirit after not many days.
ACT|1|6||And they, when assembled, asked him and said to him: Our Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
ACT|1|7||He said to them: It is not yours, to know the time or times which God hath placed in his own power.
ACT|1|8||But when the Holy Spirit shall come upon you, ye will receive energy, and will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and also among the Samaritans, and unto the ends of the earth.
ACT|1|9||And when he had said these things, while they beheld him, he was taken up, and a cloud received him, and he was hidden from their eyes.
ACT|1|10||And while they were looking toward heaven, as he departed, two men were found standing near them, in white garments,
ACT|1|11||and saying to them: Ye Galilean men, why stand ye and look toward heaven? This Jesus, who is taken up from you to heaven, will so come, as ye have seen him ascend to heaven.
ACT|1|12||And afterwards they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the place of Olives, which was near to Jerusalem, and distant from it about seven furlongs.
ACT|1|13||And when they had entered, they went to an upper chamber; where were Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, and Philip, and Thomas, and Matthew, and Bartholomew, and James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the son of James.
ACT|1|14||All these unitedly persevered in prayer, with one soul, together with the women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
ACT|1|15||And in those days stood up Simon Cephas in the midst of the disciples, (the persons there assembled being about one hundred and twenty,) and said:
ACT|1|16||Men, brethren, it was right that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to them that apprehended Jesus.
ACT|1|17||For he was numbered with us, and had a part in this ministry.
ACT|1|18||He purchased a field with the wages of sin; and he fell upon his face on the ground, and burst in the middle, and all his entrails were poured out.
ACT|1|19||And this was known to all that dwelt at Jerusalem; so that the field was called, in the language of the country, Aceldama, which is interpreted Field of Blood.
ACT|1|20||For it is written, in the book of Psalms: Let his habitation be desolate, and let no resident be in it; and let another take his service.
ACT|1|21||It should therefore be, that one of these persons, who have been with us all the time that our Lord Jesus went in and out with us,
ACT|1|22||commencing from the baptism of John, unto the day he was taken up from us,---should be, with us, a witness of his resurrection.
ACT|1|23||And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabas, whose surname was Justus, and Matthias.
ACT|1|24||And when they had prayed, they said: Thou, Lord, knowest what is in the hearts of all, manifest which thou hast chosen of these two,
ACT|1|25||that he should take part in this ministry and legateship, from which Judas broke away, that he might go to his own place.
ACT|1|26||And they cast lots, and it came upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven legates.
ACT|2|1||And when the days of pentecost were fully come, while they were all assembled together,
ACT|2|2||suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind; and the whole house where they were sitting was filled with it.
ACT|2|3||And there appeared to them tongues, which were divided like flame; and they rested upon each of them.
ACT|2|4||And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in diverse languages, as the Spirit gave them to speak.
ACT|2|5||Now there were resident at Jerusalem persons who feared God, Jews from all the nations under heaven.
ACT|2|6||And when that sound occurred, all the people collected together; and they were agitated, because they every one heard them speaking in their own languages.
ACT|2|7||And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: All these who speak behold, are they not Galileans?
ACT|2|8||And how do we hear, each his own language, in which we were born?
ACT|2|9||Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling between the rivers, Jews and Cappadocians, and those from the region of Pontus and of Asia,
ACT|2|10||and those from the region of Phrygia, and of Pamphylia, and of Egypt, and of the parts of Lybia near Cyrene, and those who have come from Rome, Jews and proselytes;
ACT|2|11||and those from Crete, and Arabians.---Lo, we hear them speak in our own languages the wonders of God.
ACT|2|12||And they all wondered and were astonished, saying one to another: From whom is this thing?
ACT|2|13||Others however ridiculed them, saying: They have drunken new wine, and are intoxicated.
ACT|2|14||And afterwards Simon Cephas rose up, with the eleven legates, and elevated his voice, and said to them: Men, Jews, and all ye that reside at Jerusalem; be this known to you, and hearken ye to my words.
ACT|2|15||For these are not intoxicated, as ye suppose: for lo, it is yet but the third hour.
ACT|2|16||But this is what was spoken by Joel the prophet:
ACT|2|17||It shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons shall prophesy, and your daughters and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
ACT|2|18||And upon my servants and my handmaids will I pour my Spirit, in those days, and they shall prophesy.
ACT|2|19||And I will give signs in heaven, and prodigies on earth, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
ACT|2|20||And the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and fearful day of the Lord come.
ACT|2|21||And it shall be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord, shall live.
ACT|2|22||Men, sons of Israel, hear ye these words: Jesus the Nazarean, a man made manifest among you by God, by those deeds of power and prodigies which God wrought among you by his hand, as ye yourselves know;
ACT|2|23||him, being hereto appointed by the prescience and the good pleasure of God,---ye have delivered into the hands of the wicked; and have crucified and slain.
ACT|2|24||But God hath resuscitated him, and hath loosed the cords of the grave; because it could not be, that he should be held in the grave.
ACT|2|25||For David said of him: I foresaw my Lord at all times; for he is on my right hand, so that I shall not be moved.
ACT|2|26||Therefore my heart doth rejoice, and my glory exult, and also my body shall abide in hope.
ACT|2|27||For thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave, nor wilt thou give thy pious one to see corruption.
ACT|2|28||Thou hast revealed to me the path of life; thou wilt fill me with joy with thy presence.
ACT|2|29||Men, brethren, I may speak to you explicitly of the patriarch David, that he died, and also was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this day.
ACT|2|30||For he was a prophet, and he knew, that God had sworn to him by an oath: Of the fruit of thy bowels, I will seat [one] on thy throne.
ACT|2|31||And he foresaw, and spoke of the resurrection of Messiah, that he was not left in the grave, neither did his body see corruption.
ACT|2|32||This Jesus hath God resuscitated; and we all are his witnesses.
ACT|2|33||And he it is, who is exalted by the right hand of God, and hath received from the Father a promise respecting the Holy Spirit, and hath sent this gift which, lo, ye see and hear.
ACT|2|34||For David hath not ascended into heaven; because he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, seat thyself at my right hand,
ACT|2|35||until I shall place thy enemies a footstool to thy feet.
ACT|2|36||Therefore, let all the house of Israel know, assuredly, that God hath made that Jesus whom ye crucified, to be Lord and Messiah.
ACT|2|37||And when they heard these things, they were agitated in their heart; and they said to Simon and to the rest of the legates: Brethren, what shall we do?
ACT|2|38||Simon said to them: Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins; so that ye may receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
ACT|2|39||For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all those afar off whom God will call.
ACT|2|40||And in many other words he testified to them, and entreated of them, saying: Live ye from this perverse generation.
ACT|2|41||And some of them readily received his discourse, and believed, and were baptized. And there were added, on that day, about three thousand souls.
ACT|2|42||And they persevered in the doctrine of the legates; and were associated together in prayer, and in breaking the eucharist.
ACT|2|43||And fear was on every mind: and many signs and prodigies were [wrought] by the hand of the legates in Jerusalem.
ACT|2|44||And all they who believed, were together; and whatever belonged to them, was of the community.
ACT|2|45||And they who had a possession, sold it, and divided to each one as he had need.
ACT|2|46||And they continued daily in the temple, with one soul: and at home, they broke bread and took food rejoicing, and in the simplicity of their heart.
ACT|2|47||And they praised God, and had favor with all the people. And our Lord added daily to the assembly those who became alive.
ACT|3|1||And it occurred, as Simon Cephas and John went together up to the temple, at the time of prayer, being the ninth hour,
ACT|3|2||that, lo, those accustomed to bring a man lame from his mother's womb, brought him and laid him at the gate of the temple called Beautiful; that he might ask alms of those going into the temple.
ACT|3|3||This man, when he saw Simon and John going into the temple, asked them to give him alms.
ACT|3|4||And Simon and John looked on him, and said to him: Look on us.
ACT|3|5||And he looked on them, expecting to receive something from them.
ACT|3|6||Simon said to him: Gold and silver, I have not; but what I have, I give to thee; in the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, the Nazarean, rise up and walk.
ACT|3|7||And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and forthwith, his feet and his heels recovered strength.
ACT|3|8||And he sprang, stood up, and walked: and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
ACT|3|9||And all the people saw him, as he walked and praised God.
ACT|3|10||And they knew that he was the beggar, who sat daily and asked alms, at the gate called Beautiful: and they were filled with wonder and admiration at what had occurred.
ACT|3|11||And as he held fast to Simon and John, all the people admiring ran to them at the portico called Solomon's.
ACT|3|12||And when Simon saw [it], he answered and said to them: Men, sons of Israel, why do ye wonder at this? or why do ye gaze on us, as if by our own power or authority we had made this man to walk?
ACT|3|13||The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he would have justified him and set him free.
ACT|3|14||But ye denied the holy and just One, and demanded that a murderer should be released to you.
ACT|3|15||And that Prince of life ye slew; and him, hath God raised from the dead, and all of us are witnesses of it.
ACT|3|16||And, by the faith in his name, he hath strengthened and cured this man, whom ye see and know; and faith in him hath given the man this soundness before you all.
ACT|3|17||And now, my brethren, I know that through misapprehensions ye did this, as did also your chiefs:
ACT|3|18||and God, according as he had previously announced by the mouth of all the prophets that the Messiah would suffer, hath in this manner fulfilled [it].
ACT|3|19||Repent, therefore, and be converted; that so your sins may be blotted out, and times of rest may come to you from before the face of the Lord;
ACT|3|20||and he may send to you him, who was made ready for you, Jesus the Messiah:
ACT|3|21||whom the heavens must retain, until the completion of the times of those things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets of old.
ACT|3|22||For Moses said: A prophet, like me, will the Lord raise up to you, from among your brethren; to him hearken ye, in all that he shall say to you.
ACT|3|23||And it will be, that every soul who will not hearken to that prophet, that soul shall perish from his people.
ACT|3|24||And all the prophets that have been, from Samuel and those after him, have spoken and proclaimed of these days.
ACT|3|25||Ye are the children of the prophets: and that covenant which God made with our fathers,---when he said to Abraham, that in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,
ACT|3|26||he hath first established to you: and God hath sent his Son to bless you, if ye will be converted, and repent of your wickedness.
ACT|4|1||And while they were speaking these words to the people, the priests and the Sadducees and the rulers of the temple rose up against them;
ACT|4|2||being angry with them, that they taught the people, and preached a resurrection from the dead by the Messiah.
ACT|4|3||And they laid hands on them, and kept them until the next day; because evening was drawing near.
ACT|4|4||And many who had heard the word, believed; and they were, in number, about five thousand men.
ACT|4|5||And the next day, the rulers and the Elders and the Scribes assembled;
ACT|4|6||and also Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and they who were of the kindred of the high priests.
ACT|4|7||And when they had set them in the midst, they interrogated them: By what power or what name, have ye done this?
ACT|4|8||Then Simon Cephas was filled with the Holy Spirit, and said to them: Ye rulers of the people, and Elders of the house of Israel, hear ye.
ACT|4|9||If we are judged by you this day, respecting the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he was healed;
ACT|4|10||be it known to you, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Messiah the Nazarean, whom ye crucified, and whom God hath raised from the dead, lo, by him, doth this [man] stand here before you recovered.
ACT|4|11||This is the stone, which ye builders rejected; and it hath become the head of the corner.
ACT|4|12||Neither is there deliverance in any other; for there is not another name under heaven, which is given to men, whereby to live.
ACT|4|13||And when they heard the speech of Simon and John, which they pronounced confidently, they reflected that these were unlearned and plebeian men, and they were surprised at them, and recognized them as having been conversant with Jesus.
ACT|4|14||And they saw that the lame man, who had been healed, stood near them; and they could say nothing to confront them.
ACT|4|15||Then they commanded to remove them from the presence of the council; and said one to another:
ACT|4|16||What shall we do to these men? For lo, that a manifest sign hath been wrought by them, is known to all that reside at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
ACT|4|17||But that the fame of it spread no further, let us interdict their speaking any more to any man in this name.
ACT|4|18||And they called them, and commanded them not to speak nor to teach at all in the name of Jesus.
ACT|4|19||Simon Cephas and John answered, and said to them: Whether it be right before God, that we hearken to you more than to God, judge ye.
ACT|4|20||For we cannot but speak that which we have seen and heard.
ACT|4|21||And they threatened them, and dismissed them. For they found no ground for punishing them, because of the people: for every one praised God for what had been done;
ACT|4|22||for the man, on whom this sign of healing had been wrought, was more than forty years old.
ACT|4|23||And when they were dismissed, they went to their brethren, and told them all that the priests and Elders had said.
ACT|4|24||And they, when they heard [it], unitedly lifted up their voice to God and said: Lord, thou art God, who hast made heaven, and earth, and seas, and every thing in them.
ACT|4|25||And it is thou who hast said, by the Holy Spirit in the mouth of David thy servant: Why do the nations rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
ACT|4|26||The kings of the earth and the potentates stood up, and they consulted together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.
ACT|4|27||For, in reality, against thy holy Son Jesus whom thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, with the Gentiles and the congregation of Israel, have been combined together in this city,
ACT|4|28||to do whatever thy hand and thy pleasure previously marked out to be done.
ACT|4|29||And also now, Lord, behold and see their menaces: and grant to thy servants, that they may proclaim thy word boldly,
ACT|4|30||while thou extendest thy hand for cures and prodigies, to be done in the name of thy holy Son Jesus.
ACT|4|31||And when they had prayed and made supplications, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God boldly.
ACT|4|32||And in the assembly of the persons that believed, there was one soul, and one mind: and no one of them said, of the property he possessed, that it was his own; but whatever was theirs, it was the community's.
ACT|4|33||And with great power, the legates testified to the resurrection of Jesus Messiah: and great grace was with them all.
ACT|4|34||And no one among them was destitute; for those who possessed lands or houses, sold, and brought the price of what was sold,
ACT|4|35||and placed [it] at the feet of the legates; and distribution was made to every one, as he had need.
ACT|4|36||And Joseph, who by the legates was surnamed Barnabas, (which is interpreted Son of Consolation,) a Levite of the country of Cyprus,
ACT|4|37||had a field: and he sold it, and brought the price of it, and laid [it] before the feet of the legates.
ACT|5|1||And a certain man whose name was Ananias, with his wife whose name was Sapphira, sold his field,
ACT|5|2||and carried away [part] of the price and concealed it, his wife consenting; and he brought [a part] of the money, and laid [it] before the feet of the legates.
ACT|5|3||And Simon said to him: Ananias, why hath Satan so filled thy heart, that thou shouldst lie against the Holy Spirit, and conceal of the money of the price of the field?
ACT|5|4||Was it not thine own before it was sold? And when sold, again thou hadst authority over the price of it. Why hast thou set thy heart to do this purpose? Thou hast not lied against men, but against God.
ACT|5|5||And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down, and died. And great fear was upon all them that heard [of it].
ACT|5|6||And the young men among them arose, and gathered him up, and carried [him] out, and buried him.
ACT|5|7||And when three hours had passed, his wife also came in, without knowing what had occurred.
ACT|5|8||Simon said to her: Tell me, if ye sold the field for this price? And she said: Yes, for this price.
ACT|5|9||Simon said to her: Since ye have been equals in tempting the Spirit of the Lord, lo, the feet of the buriers of thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.
ACT|5|10||And immediately she fell before their feet, and died. And those young men came in, and found her dead; and they took up, carried forth, and buried her by the side of her husband.
ACT|5|11||And great fear was on all the assembly, and on all them that heard [it].
ACT|5|12||And there were many signs and prodigies wrought by the legates among the people. And they were all assembled together in the porch of Solomon.
ACT|5|13||And of the others, no one ventured to come near them; but the people magnified them.
ACT|5|14||And the more were those added who feared the Lord, a multitude both of men and of women.
ACT|5|15||So that they brought out into the streets the sick, laid on beds, that when Simon should pass, at least his shadow might cover them.
ACT|5|16||And many came to them from other cities around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those who had unclean spirits; and they were all cured.
ACT|5|17||And the high priest was filled with indignation, and all those with him who were of the doctrine of the Sadducees.
ACT|5|18||And they laid hands on the legates, and took and bound them in prison.
ACT|5|19||Then the angel of the Lord, by night, opened the door of the prison, and let them out; and said to them:
ACT|5|20||Go, stand in the temple, and speak to the people all these words of life.
ACT|5|21||And in the morning, they went and entered into the temple, and taught. And the high priest and those with him, convoked their associates and the Elders of Israel, and sent to the prison to bring forth the legates.
ACT|5|22||And when those sent by them went, they found them not in the prison; and they returned and came back,
ACT|5|23||and said: We found the prison carefully closed, and also the keepers standing before the doors; and we opened, but found no one there.
ACT|5|24||And when the chief priests and rulers of the temple heard these words, they were astonished at them; and they studied what this could mean.
ACT|5|25||And one came and informed them: Those men, whom ye shut up in the prison, lo, they are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
ACT|5|26||Then went the rulers with attendants, to bring them without violence; for they feared, lest the people should stone them.
ACT|5|27||And when they had brought them, they placed them before the whole council; and the high priest began to say to them:
ACT|5|28||Did we not strictly charge you, to teach no person in this name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine; and ye would bring the blood of this man upon us.
ACT|5|29||And Simon, with the legates, answered and said to them: God is to be obeyed, rather than men.
ACT|5|30||The God of our fathers hath raised up that Jesus, whom ye slew when ye hanged him on a tree.
ACT|5|31||Him hath God established as a head and vivifier; and hath exalted him to his own right hand, so that he might give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.
ACT|5|32||And we are the witnesses of these things; and also the Holy Spirit, whom God giveth to them that believe in him.
ACT|5|33||And when they heard these things, they burned with indignation, and thought of putting them to death.
ACT|5|34||Then rose up one of the Pharisees whose name was Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, and honored by all the people; and he directed them to put the legates aside for a short time.
ACT|5|35||And he said, to them: Men, sons of Israel, take heed to yourselves, and consider what ye ought to do in regard to these men.
ACT|5|36||For before this time, rose up Theudas, and said of himself, that he was some great one; and there went after him about four hundred men. And he was slain; and they who went after him, were dispersed and became as nothing.
ACT|5|37||And after him, rose up Judas a Galilean, in the days when the people were enrolled for the capitation tax; and he seduced much people after him. And he died, and all they that went after him were dispersed.
ACT|5|38||And now, I say to you: Desist from these men, and let them alone. For if this device and this work originate from men, they will dissolve and come to nothing.
ACT|5|39||But if it be from God, it is not in your power to frustrate it: that ye may not be found placing yourselves in opposition to God.---And they assented to him.
ACT|5|40||And they called the legates, and scourged them, and commanded them not to teach in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.
ACT|5|41||And they went from before them, rejoicing that they were worthy to suffer abuse on account of that name.
ACT|5|42||And they ceased not to teach daily, in the temple and at home, and to preach concerning our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|6|1||And in those days, when the disciples had become numerous, the Grecian disciples murmured against the Hebrew, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration [to the needy].
ACT|6|2||And the twelve legates convoked the whole company of the disciples, and said to them: It is not proper, that we should neglect the word of God, and serve tables.
ACT|6|3||Therefore brethren, search out, and elect from among you, seven men of whom there is good testimony, men full of the Spirit of the Lord, and of wisdom; that we may place them over this business:
ACT|6|4||and we will continue in prayer, and in the ministration of the word.
ACT|6|5||And this proposal was acceptable before all the people. And they elected Stephen, a man who was full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas an Antiochian proselyte.
ACT|6|6||These stood before the legates; and when they had prayed, they laid the hand on them.
ACT|6|7||And the word of God increased, and the number of disciples was enlarged at Jerusalem greatly; and many people from among the Jews, were obedient to the faith.
ACT|6|8||And Stephen was full of grace and energy; and he wrought signs and prodigies among the people.
ACT|6|9||And there rose up some of the synagogue which is called that of the freed men, Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and persons from Cilicia and from Asia; and they disputed with Stephen.
ACT|6|10||And they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit that spoke by him.
ACT|6|11||Then they sent men, and instructed them to say: We have heard him speak words of blasphemy, against Moses and against God.
ACT|6|12||And they excited the people, and the Elders, and the Scribes; and they came, and rose upon him, and seized him, and carried him into the midst of the council.
ACT|6|13||And they set up false witnesses, who said: This man ceaseth not to utter words contrary to the law, and against this holy place.
ACT|6|14||For we have heard him say, that this Jesus the Nazarean will destroy this place, and will change the rites which Moses delivered to you.
ACT|6|15||And all they who were sitting in the council looked upon him, and they beheld his face, as the face of an angel.
ACT|7|1||And the high priest asked him: Are these things so?
ACT|7|2||And he said: Men, brethren, and our fathers, hear ye. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was between the rivers, before he came to reside in Charran;
ACT|7|3||and he said to him: Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and go to a land which I will show to thee.
ACT|7|4||And then Abraham departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and came and dwelt in Charran. And from there, after his father had died, God removed him to this land, in which ye this day dwell.
ACT|7|5||And he did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a foot-track: but he promised that he would give it him, as an inheritance to him and to his seed, when as yet he had no son.
ACT|7|6||And God conversed with him, and said to him: Thy seed will be a sojourner in a foreign land; and they will reduce it to servitude, and will treat it ill, during four hundred years.
ACT|7|7||And the nation, to whom they perform bondservice, I will judge saith God. And afterwards, they will go out, and will worship me in this land.
ACT|7|8||And he gave them the covenant of circumcision. And then he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. And Isaac begat Jacob: and Jacob begat our twelve fathers.
ACT|7|9||And those our fathers envied Joseph, and sold him into Egypt: but God was with him,
ACT|7|10||and delivered him from all his afflictions; and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him chief over Egypt, and over all his house.
ACT|7|11||And there was a famine and great distress in all Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, and our fathers lacked food.
ACT|7|12||And when Jacob heard that there was bread-stuff in Egypt, he sent our fathers a first time.
ACT|7|13||And when they went the second time, Joseph made himself known to his brethren; and the kindred of Joseph was known to Pharaoh.
ACT|7|14||And Joseph sent and brought is father Jacob, and all his family; and they were in number seventy and five souls.
ACT|7|15||And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died there, he and our fathers.
ACT|7|16||And he was transported to Sychem, and was deposited in the sepulchre which Abraham bought with money of the sons of Emmor.
ACT|7|17||And when the time arrived for that which God had promised to Abraham with an oath, the people had multiplied and become strong, in Egypt:
ACT|7|18||until there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
ACT|7|19||And he dealt craftily with our kindred, and ill-treated our fathers, and gave orders that their infants should be cast away, and should not live.
ACT|7|20||At that time was Moses born; and he was lovely to God: and he was nursed three months in his father's house.
ACT|7|21||And when he was cast out, by his people, the daughter of Pharaoh found him, and brought him up for her own son.
ACT|7|22||And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was eminent in his words, and also in his deeds.
ACT|7|23||And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.
ACT|7|24||And he saw one of the race of his kindred treated with violence; and he avenged him, and did him justice, and killed the Egyptian who had abused him.
ACT|7|25||And he supposed that his brethren the sons of Israel would have understood, that by his hand God would give them deliverance; but they understood not.
ACT|7|26||And on another day, he appeared to them, as they were quarrelling one with another. And he exhorted them to become reconciled, saying: Men, ye are brethren; why do ye seek to harm each other?
ACT|7|27||But he who did the wrong to his fellow, repulsed him from him, and said to him: Who constituted thee a ruler and a judge over us?
ACT|7|28||Dost thou seek to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
ACT|7|29||And Moses fled at that speech, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian. And he had two sons.
ACT|7|30||And when forty years had been passed by him there, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a fire that burned in a bush.
ACT|7|31||And when Moses saw [it], he admired the sight: and as he drew near to behold [it], the Lord said to him, audibly:
ACT|7|32||I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and dared not to gaze at the sight.
ACT|7|33||And the Lord said to him: Loose thy shoes from thy feet; for the ground on which thou standest is holy.
ACT|7|34||I have attentively seen the affliction of my people, who are in Egypt; and I have heard their groans, and have come down to deliver them. And now, come, I will send thee to Egypt.
ACT|7|35||This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, Who constituted thee a ruler and judge over us? this same did God, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush, send to them to be their captain and deliverer.
ACT|7|36||He it was that brought them out, working signs and wonders and prodigies in the land of Egypt, and at the sea of rushes, and in the desert, forty years.
ACT|7|37||This Moses is the man who said to the children of Israel: A prophet, like me, will the Lord God raise up to you from among your brethren; to him give ear.
ACT|7|38||He it was, who was in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel that conversed with him and with our fathers at mount Sinai; and he it was, received the living words to give [them] to us.
ACT|7|39||And our fathers would not hearken to him, but forsook him, and in their hearts returned again to Egypt;
ACT|7|40||when they said to Aaron: Make us gods who may go before us; because, as for this Moses who brought us from the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him.
ACT|7|41||And he made them a calf in those days; and they offered sacrifices to idols, and were voluptuous with the work of their hands.
ACT|7|42||And God turned away, and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven: as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did ye, for forty years, in the wilderness, present to me a slain animal or a sacrifice, ye sons of Israel?
ACT|7|43||But ye bore the tabernacle of Malchum, and the star of the god Rephon, images which ye had made, that ye might bow down to them. I will transport you beyond Babylon.
ACT|7|44||Lo, the tabernacle of the testimony of our fathers, was in the wilderness; as he who talked with Moses, commanded to make it after the form which he showed him.
ACT|7|45||And this same tabernacle, our fathers, with Joshua, actually brought into the land which God gave to them for an inheritance from those nations which he drove out before them; and it was borne about, until the days of David.
ACT|7|46||He found favor before God; and he requested, that he might find a residence for the God of Jacob.
ACT|7|47||But Solomon built the house.
ACT|7|48||Yet the most High lodgeth not in a work of [human] hands; as saith the prophet:
ACT|7|49||Heaven is my throne, and earth the footstool under my feet. What is the house, ye will build for me? saith the Lord: or, what is the place of my repose?
ACT|7|50||Lo, hath not my hand made all these things?
ACT|7|51||O ye stiff of neck, and uncircumcised in their heart, and in their hearing; ye do always set yourselves against the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, so also ye.
ACT|7|52||For, which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute and kill, [even] them, who foretold the coming of the Just One, whom ye delivered up and slew?
ACT|7|53||And ye have received the law by the ordination of angels, and have not kept it.
ACT|7|54||And when they heard these things, they were filled with rage in their souls; and they gnashed their teeth against him.
ACT|7|55||And he, as he was full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, looked towards heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
ACT|7|56||And he said: Lo, I see heaven open, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
ACT|7|57||And they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and all rushed upon him.
ACT|7|58||And they seized him, and hurried him out of the city, and stoned him. And they who testified against him, laid their clothes at the feet of a certain young man who was called Saul.
ACT|7|59||And they stoned Stephen, while he prayed and said: Our Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
ACT|7|60||And when he had kneeled down, he cried with a loud voice, and said: Our Lord, establish not this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT|8|1||And Saul was consenting and participating in his death.---And there was, in that day, a great persecution against the church that was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed, except the legates, among the villages of Judaea and likewise among the Samaritans.
ACT|8|2||And believing men gathered up and buried Stephen. And they lamented over him greatly.
ACT|8|3||And Saul persecuted the church of God, entering houses, and dragging forth men and women and committing them to prison.
ACT|8|4||And they who were dispersed, travelled about, and preached the word of God.
ACT|8|5||And Philip went down to a city of the Samaritans, and preached concerning the Messiah.
ACT|8|6||And when the people who were there heard his discourse, they gave ear to him, and acquiesced in all that he said; because they saw the signs which he wrought.
ACT|8|7||For many who were possessed by unclean spirits, cried with a loud voice, and came out of them: and others, who were paralytic and lame, were healed.
ACT|8|8||And there was great joy in that city.
ACT|8|9||And there was a certain man there, whose name was Simon, who had resided in that city a long time, and who seduced the people of the Samaritans by his sorceries, magnifying himself, and saying, I am a great personage.
ACT|8|10||And they all inclined towards him, great and small; and they said, This is the mighty power of God.
ACT|8|11||And they acquiesced in him, because for a long time he had astonished them by his sorceries.
ACT|8|12||But when they gave credence to Philip, as he preached the kingdom of God, in the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah; they were baptized, both men and women.
ACT|8|13||And Simon himself also believed, and was baptized, and adhered to Philip. And when he saw the signs and mighty deeds which were wrought by his hand, he was surprised and astonished.
ACT|8|14||And when the legates at Jerusalem, heard that the people of the Samaritans had received the word of God, they sent out to them Simon Cephas and John.
ACT|8|15||And they went down, and prayed over them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
ACT|8|16||For he was not yet on any one of them; and they had only been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus.
ACT|8|17||Then they laid the hand on them; and they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT|8|18||And when Simon saw that, by the imposition of a hand of the legates, the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
ACT|8|19||saying: Give me also this prerogative, that he on whom I impose a hand, may receive the Holy Spirit.
ACT|8|20||Simon Cephas said to him: Thy money go with thee to perdition! because thou hast supposed, that the gift of God may be purchased by a worldly substance.
ACT|8|21||Thou hast no part nor lot in this faith; because thy heart is not right before God.
ACT|8|22||Nevertheless, repent of this thy wickedness, and entreat of God, if perhaps the guile of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
ACT|8|23||For I perceive that thou art in the bitter gall and in the bonds of iniquity.
ACT|8|24||Simon answered and said: Intercede ye with God for me, that nothing of which ye have mentioned may come upon me.
ACT|8|25||And Simon and John, when they had testified, and had taught them the word of God, returned to Jerusalem. And they had preached in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT|8|26||And the angel of the Lord spake with Philip, and said to him: Arise, go to the south, along the desert way that leadeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
ACT|8|27||And he arose and went. And there met him a eunuch, who had come from Cush, an officer of Candace, queen of the Cushites, who had charge of all her treasure; and he had come to worship at Jerusalem.
ACT|8|28||And as he turned to go, he was sitting in his chariot, and was reading in Isaiah the prophet.
ACT|8|29||And the Holy Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to the chariot.
ACT|8|30||And when he came near, he heard him reading in Isaiah the prophet; and he said to him: Understandest thou what thou readest?
ACT|8|31||And he said: How can I understand, unless some one instruct me? And he requested of Philip, that he would come up and sit with him.
ACT|8|32||And the section of scripture in which he was reading, was this: As a lamb to the slaughter he was led away, and as a sheep before the shearer is silent, so also he in his humility opened not his mouth.
ACT|8|33||From prison and from judgment he was carried: and his generation, who will declare? for his life is taken away from the earth.
ACT|8|34||And the eunuch said to Philip: I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other person?
ACT|8|35||Then Philip opened his mouth and, from that scripture, began to preach to him concerning our Lord Jesus.
ACT|8|36||And as they proceeded on the way, they came to a certain place in which there was water. And the eunuch said: Lo, [here is] water; what doth forbid, that I should be baptized?
ACT|8|37||[And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, it is allowable. And he answered, and said: I believe that Jesus Messiah is the Son of God.]
ACT|8|38||And he commanded the chariot to stop; and they both went down to the water, and Philip baptized the eunuch.
ACT|8|39||And when they came up from the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more; but he went on his way rejoicing.
ACT|8|40||And Philip was found at Azotus; and from there he travelled about, and preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
ACT|9|1||And Saul was still full of threats and deadly hatred against the disciples of our Lord.
ACT|9|2||And he requested that a letter from the high priest might be given him unto Damascus to the synagogues; that if he should find persons pursuing this course, men or women, he might bind and bring them to Jerusalem.
ACT|9|3||And as he was going, and began to approach Damascus, suddenly there was poured upon him a light from heaven.
ACT|9|4||And he fell to the ground; and he heard a voice which said to him: Saul! Saul! why persecutest thou me? It will be hard for thee to kick against the goads.
ACT|9|5||He replied, and said: Who art thou, my Lord? And our Lord said: I am Jesus the Nazarean, whom thou persecutest.
ACT|9|6||But arise and go into the city, and there it will be told thee what thou oughtest to do.
ACT|9|7||And the men who travelled with him in the way, stood amazed; for they heard merely the voice, and no one was visible to them.
ACT|9|8||And Saul arose from the ground; and nothing was visible to him, with his eyes opened. And they took him by the hand, and led him into Damascus.
ACT|9|9||And he had no sight for three days; and he neither ate nor drank.
ACT|9|10||And there was in Damascus a certain disciple, whose name was Ananias. And the Lord said to him, in a vision: Ananias! And he said: Lo, I [am here], my Lord.
ACT|9|11||And our Lord said to him: Arise, go to the street which is called Straight; and inquire in the house of Judas, for Saul who is from the city of Tarsus: for, lo, while he prayed,
ACT|9|12||he saw in vision a man named Ananias, who came and laid his hand upon him, that his eyes might be opened.
ACT|9|13||And Ananias said: My Lord, I have heard of this man, from many, how much evil he hath perpetrated towards thy saints at Jerusalem.
ACT|9|14||And, lo, here also, he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all them that call on thy name.
ACT|9|15||The Lord said to him: Arise and go; for he is to me a chosen vessel, to carry my name to the Gentiles, and to kings, and among the sons of Israel.
ACT|9|16||For I will show him, how much he is to suffer on account of my name.
ACT|9|17||Then Ananias went to the house to him; and he laid his hand upon him, and said to him: Saul, my brother, our Lord Jesus, he who appeared to thee by the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thy eyes might be opened, and thou be filled with the Holy Spirit.
ACT|9|18||And immediately there fell from his eyes something like a scab; and his eyes were opened. And he arose and was baptized.
ACT|9|19||And he took food, and was invigorated.---And he was [some] days with the disciples of Damascus.
ACT|9|20||And forthwith he announced Jesus, in the synagogues of the Jews, that he is the Son of God.
ACT|9|21||And all they that heard him were amazed; and they said: Is not this he, who persecuted all them that call on this name in Jerusalem? And lo, for this very thing also, was he sent hither, that he might bind and carry them to the chief priests.
ACT|9|22||But Saul was the more strengthened; and he confounded those Jews who dwelt at Damascus, while he demonstrated that this is the Messiah.
ACT|9|23||And when he had been there many days, the Jews formed a conspiracy against him, to kill him.
ACT|9|24||And the plot which they sought to execute upon him, was made known to Saul: and they watched the gates of the city by day and by night, in order to kill him.
ACT|9|25||Then the disciples placed him in a basket, and let him down from the wall by night.
ACT|9|26||And he went to Jerusalem; and he wished to join himself with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.
ACT|9|27||But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the legates, and related to them how the Lord appeared to him in the way, and how he conversed with him; and how, in Damascus, he had discoursed openly in the name of Jesus.
ACT|9|28||And he went in and out with them, at Jerusalem.
ACT|9|29||And he spoke openly in the name of Jesus and disputed with those Jews who understood Greek. But they wished to kill him:
ACT|9|30||and when the brethren knew [it], they conducted him by night to Caesarea, and from there they sent him to Tarsus.
ACT|9|31||Moreover the church, in all Judaea, and in Galilee, and in Samaria, had peace and was edified; and it walked in the fear of God, and abounded in the consolation of the Holy Spirit.
ACT|9|32||And it occurred, that, as Simon travelled about the cities, he came down to the saints also who dwelt in the city of Lydda.
ACT|9|33||And he found a certain man whose name was neas, who had lain on a bed and been paralytic eight years.
ACT|9|34||And Simon said to him: neas, Jesus the Messiah doth heal thee; arise, and spread thy bed. And he rose up immediately.
ACT|9|35||And all they that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, saw him; and they turned to God.
ACT|9|36||And there was in the city of Joppa, a certain female disciple named Tabitha; [and] she was rich in good works, and in the alms which she did.
ACT|9|37||And she fell sick in those days, and died; and they washed her, and laid her in an upper room.
ACT|9|38||And the disciples heard that Simon was in the city of Lydda, which is near to Joppa; and they sent two men to him, to request of him that he would not delay to come to them.
ACT|9|39||And Simon arose and went with them. And when he arrived, they conducted him to the chamber; and there were assembled around her all the widows, weeping, and showing him the tunics and the cloaks which Tabitha had given them when alive.
ACT|9|40||And Simon put all the people out, and fell on his knees and prayed; and he turned to the corpse and said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Simon, she sat up.
ACT|9|41||And he reached to her his hand, and raised her up: and he called the saints and the widows, and presented her to them alive.
ACT|9|42||And this became known throughout the city; and many believed on our Lord.
ACT|9|43||And he tarried in Joppa not a few days: and he lodged in the house of Simon a tanner.
ACT|10|1||And there was a certain man in Caesarea, whose name was Cornelius, a centurion of the regiment called the Italian.
ACT|10|2||And he was righteous, and feared God, he and all his house; [and] he did much alms among the people, and prayed to God at all times.
ACT|10|3||This man distinctly saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God, who came in to him and said to him: Cornelius!
ACT|10|4||And he looked upon him, and was afraid; and he said: What, my Lord? And the angel said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms have come up in remembrance before God.
ACT|10|5||And now, send men to the city of Joppa, and bring Simon who is called Cephas.
ACT|10|6||Lo, he lodgeth in the house of Simon the tanner, which is by the side of the sea.
ACT|10|7||And when the angel that talked with him was gone, he called two of his household, and a soldier who feared God and was obedient to him.
ACT|10|8||And he related to them all that he had seen, and sent them to Joppa.
ACT|10|9||And the next day, as they travelled the road and approached the city, Simon ascended the roof to pray, at the sixth hour.
ACT|10|10||And he became hungry, and desired to eat. And while they were providing for him, he fell into a trance.
ACT|10|11||And he saw the heavens opened, and a certain vessel fastened at the four corners, and it was like a great sheet; and it descended from heaven to the earth.
ACT|10|12||And there were in it all fourfooted animals, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of heaven.
ACT|10|13||And a voice came to him, which said: Simon, arise, slay and eat.
ACT|10|14||And Simon said: Far be it, my Lord: for never have I eaten any thing unclean and polluted.
ACT|10|15||And again the second time, there was a voice to him: What God hath cleansed, make thou not unclean.
ACT|10|16||And this was done three times; and the vessel was taken up to heaven.
ACT|10|17||And while Simon was wondering with himself, what the vision he had seen could denote, the men who were sent by Cornelius arrived; and they inquired for the house in which Simon lodged, and came and stood at the gate of the court.
ACT|10|18||And there they called out, and asked if Simon who is called Cephas lodged there?
ACT|10|19||And while Simon was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him: Lo, three men are inquiring for thee.
ACT|10|20||Arise, go down, and accompany them; and let not thy mind hesitate, for I have sent them.
ACT|10|21||Then Simon went down to the men, and said to them: I am he for whom ye inquire: what is the cause for which ye have come?
ACT|10|22||They say to him: A certain man whose name is Cornelius, a centurion fearing God, and of whom all the people of the Jews bear good report, was told in vision, by a holy angel, to send and bring thee to his house, that he might hear discourse from thee.
ACT|10|23||And Simon led them in, and entertained them where he lodged. And the following day, he arose, departed, and went with them: and some of the brethren of Joppa also went with them.
ACT|10|24||And the next day, they entered Caesarea. And Cornelius was expecting them: and all the kindred of his family, and also such intimate friends as he had, were assembled with him.
ACT|10|25||And as Simon came up, Cornelius met him, and fell down worshipping at his feet.
ACT|10|26||And Simon raised him up, and said to him: Arise; I also am a man.
ACT|10|27||And as he talked with him, he went in, and found that many had come there.
ACT|10|28||And he said to them: Ye know, that it is not lawful for a Jewish man, to associate with an alien who is not of his race: but God hath showed me, that I should not say of any one, that he is defiled or unclean.
ACT|10|29||Therefore I came readily, when ye sent for me. But, I ask you, for what cause did ye send for me?
ACT|10|30||And Cornelius said to him: It is four days ago, that, lo, I was fasting; and at the ninth hour, while I was praying in my house, a certain man stood before me, clothed in white,
ACT|10|31||and said to me: Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and there is remembrance of thy alms before God.
ACT|10|32||But send to the city of Joppa, and bring Simon who is called Cephas: lo, he lodgeth in the house of Simon the tanner, which is by the side of the sea. And he will come and converse with thee.
ACT|10|33||And immediately I sent to thee; and thou hast done well to come: and lo, we are all of us before thee, and desirous to hear whatever is commanded thee from God.
ACT|10|34||And Simon opened his mouth, and said: Truly I discover that God is no respecter of persons.
ACT|10|35||but, among all the nations, he who feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable with him.
ACT|10|36||For [this is] the word, which he sent to the sons of Israel, announcing to them peace and rest by Jesus Messiah,---He is Lord of all;
ACT|10|37||and ye also know the word, which was in all Judaea, which commenced from Galilee, after the baptism that John preached,
ACT|10|38||concerning Jesus, who was of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power. And he it was, who went about and healed those that were suffering from evil, because God was with him.
ACT|10|39||And we [are] his witnesses, as to whatever he did in all the region of Judaea and in Jerusalem. This same person the Jews hanged on a tree, and slew him.
ACT|10|40||And him did God raise up, on the third day; and caused him to be seen with naked eyes;
ACT|10|41||not indeed by all the people, but by us, who were chosen of God to be his witnesses, [and] who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.
ACT|10|42||And he commanded us to proclaim and testify to the people, that he is appointed of God to be judge of the living and of the dead.
ACT|10|43||And of him all the prophets testify, that whoever believeth in his name, will receive remission of sins.
ACT|10|44||And while Simon was uttering these things, the Holy Spirit overshadowed all them that were hearing the word.
ACT|10|45||And the circumcised brethren who came with him, were amazed and astonished, that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also.
ACT|10|46||For they heard them speak with diverse tongues, and magnify God.
ACT|10|47||And Simon said: Can any one forbid water, that those should not be baptized, they who have received, lo, the Holy Spirit, as well as we?
ACT|10|48||Then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah. And they requested him to remain with them [some] days.
ACT|11|1||And it was reported to the legates and the brethren in Judaea, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
ACT|11|2||And when Simon went up to Jerusalem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,
ACT|11|3||saying; that he had gone in to be with uncircumcised persons, and had eaten with them.
ACT|11|4||And Simon began to address them methodically:
ACT|11|5||As I was in Joppa, praying, I saw in vision, that a certain vessel descended, which was like a sheet, and it was tied at its four corners; and it descended from heaven and came to me.
ACT|11|6||And I looked upon it, and I saw that in it were fourfooted animals, and reptiles of the earth, and fowls of heaven.
ACT|11|7||And I heard a voice, which said to me: Simon, arise, slay and eat.
ACT|11|8||And I said: Far be it, my Lord. For never hath any thing polluted or unclean entered my mouth.
ACT|11|9||And again, a voice from heaven said to me: What God hath cleansed, make thou not unclean.
ACT|11|10||And this was done three times: and the whole was taken up to heaven.
ACT|11|11||And at the same instant, three men, who were sent to me by Cornelius from Caesarea, came and stood at the gate of the court where I lodged.
ACT|11|12||And the Spirit said to me: Go with them, without hesitation. And these six brethren went also with me, and we entered the man's house.
ACT|11|13||And he related to us, how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him: Send to the city of Joppa, and bring Simon who is called Cephas;
ACT|11|14||and he will utter to thee discourses, by which thou wilt live, thou and all thy house.
ACT|11|15||And when I there commenced speaking, the Holy Spirit overshadowed them, as it did us from the beginning.
ACT|11|16||And I remembered the word of our Lord, when he said: John baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
ACT|11|17||If then God equally gave the gift to the Gentiles that believed in our Lord Jesus Messiah, as he did to us: who was I, that I could forbid God?
ACT|11|18||And when they heard these words, they desisted; and they glorified God and said: Now to the Gentiles also doth God give repentance unto life.
ACT|11|19||And they who were dispersed, by the oppression which occurred on account of Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and even to the country of Cyprus, and to Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only.
ACT|11|20||And there were some of them from Cyprus and from Cyrene, who went up to Antioch, and spoke to the Greeks, and preached concerning our Lord Jesus.
ACT|11|21||And the hand of the Lord was with them; and many believed, and turned to the Lord.
ACT|11|22||And this came to the ears of the sons of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
ACT|11|23||And when he came there, and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced: and he entreated them, that with all their heart, they would adhere to our Lord.
ACT|11|24||For he was a good man, and was full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith. And many people were added to our Lord.
ACT|11|25||And he went away to Tarsus, to seek for Saul.
ACT|11|26||And when he had found him, he brought him with him to Antioch. And a whole year they met together in the church, and instructed many people.---From that time forth, the disciples were first called CHRISTIANS, at Antioch.
ACT|11|27||In those days came prophets thither from Jerusalem.
ACT|11|28||And one of them whose name was Agabus, stood up and informed them, by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine in all the country. And that famine occurred in the days of Claudius Caesar.
ACT|11|29||And moreover the disciples, each of them according to his several ability, determined to send to the relief of the brethren who dwelt in Judaea.
ACT|11|30||And they sent, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul, unto the Elders there.
ACT|12|1||And at that time Herod the king, who was surnamed Agrippa, laid hands on some of the church, to maltreat them.
ACT|12|2||And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
ACT|12|3||And when he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded also to arrest Simon Cephas. And the days of unleavened bread were then passing.
ACT|12|4||He seized him and cast him into prison, and delivered him to sixteen soldiers, who were to guard him; that he might, after the passover, deliver him up to the people of the Jews.
ACT|12|5||And while Simon was in custody in the prison, continual prayer to God in his behalf, was offered to God by the church.
ACT|12|6||And on the night before the morning in which he was to be delivered up, while Simon was sleeping between two soldiers, and was bound with two chains, and others were guarding the doors of the prison;
ACT|12|7||an angel of the Lord stood over him, and a light shone in all the building; and he pricked his side, and awaked him, and said to him: Arise, instantly. And the chains fell from his hands.
ACT|12|8||And the angel said to him: Gird thy loins, and put on thy sandals. And he did so. And again he said to him: Wrap thyself in thy cloak, and come after me.
ACT|12|9||And he went out and followed him, not knowing that what had been done by the angel was a reality; for he supposed, that he saw a vision.
ACT|12|10||And when the first ward was passed and the second, they came to the iron gate, and it opened to them of its own accord. And when they had gone out, and had passed one street, the angel departed from him.
ACT|12|11||Then Simon recognized [where he was]; and he said: Now I know, in reality, that God hath sent his angel, and delivered me from the hand of Herod the king, and from what the Jews were devising against me.
ACT|12|12||And when he had considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark; because many brethren were assembled there and praying.
ACT|12|13||And he knocked at the gate of the court; and a maid named Rhoda came to reply to him.
ACT|12|14||And she recognized the voice of Simon: and, In her joy, she did not open to him the gate, but ran back, and told them: Lo, Simon is standing at the gate of the court.
ACT|12|15||They said to her: Thou art delirious. But she maintained that it was a fact. They said to her: Perhaps it is his ghost.
ACT|12|16||And Simon was knocking at the gate; and they went out, saw him, and were astonished.
ACT|12|17||And he beckoned to them with the hand to be still; and he went in, and related to them how the Lord had released him from the prison. And he said to them: Tell these things to James and to the brethren. And he went out, and departed to another place.
ACT|12|18||And when it was morning, there was a great dispute among the soldiers concerning Simon, what had become of him.
ACT|12|19||And Herod, when he sought him, and could not find him, arraigned the keepers, and sentenced them to die. And he went from Judaea, and resided at Caesarea.
ACT|12|20||And because he was angry against the Tyrians and Sidonians, they assembled and came to him in a body; and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they begged of him that they might have peace; because the supplies of their country were derived from the kingdom of Herod.
ACT|12|21||And on a day appointed, Herod was arrayed in royal apparel, and sat on a tribunal, and made a speech to the assembly.
ACT|12|22||And all the people shouted, and said: These are the utterances of a God, and not of a mortal.
ACT|12|23||And, because he gave not the glory to God, immediately the angel of God smote him; and he was eaten of worms, and died.
ACT|12|24||And the gospel of God was proclaimed, and made progress.
ACT|12|25||And Barnabas and Saul, after they had completed their ministration, returned from Jerusalem to Antioch. And they took with them John, who was surnamed Mark.
ACT|13|1||Now there were in the church at Antioch, [several] prophets and teachers; Barnabas, and Simon called Niger, and Lucius who was from the city Cyrene, and Menaen, a son of the guardians of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.
ACT|13|2||And while they were fasting and making supplication to God, the Holy Spirit said to them: Separate to me Saul and Barnabas, for the work to which I have called them.
ACT|13|3||And after they had fasted and prayed, they laid the hand on them, and sent them away.
ACT|13|4||And they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they went by sea as far as Cyprus.
ACT|13|5||And when they entered the city of Salamis, they announced the word of our Lord in the synagogues of the Jews. And John ministered to them.
ACT|13|6||And when they had travelled over the whole island as far as the city Paphos, they found a certain man, a sorcerer, a Jew, who was a false prophet, and whose name was Bar-Suma.
ACT|13|7||He adhered to a wise man, who was the proconsul, and was called Sergius Paulus. And the proconsul sent for Saul and Barnabas, and requested to hear from them the word of God.
ACT|13|8||And this sorcerer, Bar-Suma, (whose name is interpreted, Elymas,) withstood them; because he wished to divert the proconsul from the faith.
ACT|13|9||And Saul who is called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit; and he looked upon him,
ACT|13|10||and said: O thou full of all subtilties, and all mischiefs, thou child of the calumniator, and enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
ACT|13|11||And now, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, and shalt not see the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and he went about, inquiring who would take him by the hand.
ACT|13|12||And when the proconsul saw what occurred, he was astonished; and he believed the doctrine of the Lord.
ACT|13|13||And Paul and Barnabas went by sea, from the city of Paphos, and came to Perga, a city of Pamphylia. And John separated from them, and went away to Jerusalem.
ACT|13|14||And they departed from Perga, and came to Antioch, a city of Pisidia: and they entered the synagogue, on the sabbath day, and sat down.
ACT|13|15||And after the law had been read, and the prophets, the Elders of the synagogue sent to them, and said: Men, brethren, if ye have a word of exhortation, address the people.
ACT|13|16||And Paul arose, and waved his hand, and said: Men, sons of Israel, and ye that fear God, hear ye.
ACT|13|17||The God of this people chose our fathers, and raised them up, and multiplied them, when they resided in the land of Egypt; and, with a high arm, he brought them out of it.
ACT|13|18||And he fed them in the wilderness forty years.
ACT|13|19||And he extirpated seven nations in the land of Canaan, and gave them their land for an inheritance.
ACT|13|20||And for four hundred and fifty years he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.
ACT|13|21||And then they asked for themselves a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years.
ACT|13|22||And he removed him, and raised up to them David as king: and he testified of him, and said: I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart: he will do all my pleasure.
ACT|13|23||From the seed of this man, hath God raised up to Israel, as he promised, Jesus a deliverer.
ACT|13|24||And, before his advent, he sent John to proclaim the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
ACT|13|25||And while John was fulfilling his ministry, he said: Who, suppose ye, that I am? I am not he. But lo, he cometh after me; of whom I am not worthy to untie his shoe-strings.
ACT|13|26||Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and all who, with you, fear God, to you is this word of life sent.
ACT|13|27||For, those inhabitants of Jerusalem and their chiefs, did not apprehend it; neither [did they apprehend] also the writings of the prophets, which are read every sabbath; but they condemned him, and fulfilled all the things written.
ACT|13|28||And while they found no ground for [his] death, they desired of Pilate that they might kill him.
ACT|13|29||And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning him, they took him down from the cross, and laid him in a sepulchre.
ACT|13|30||But God raised him from the dead.
ACT|13|31||And he was seen many days, by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem; and they are now his witnesses to the people.
ACT|13|32||And lo, we also announce to you, that the promise, which was made to our fathers,
ACT|13|33||lo, God hath fulfilled it to us their children, in that he raised up Jesus; as it is written in the second psalm: Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
ACT|13|34||And God hath so raised him from the dead, that he will not return again and see corruption; as he said: I will give to you the sure grace of David.
ACT|13|35||And again he said, in another place: Thou hast not given thy devout one to see corruption.
ACT|13|36||For David, in his generation, served the pleasure of God, and went to rest, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption.
ACT|13|37||But this person, whom God raised up, did not see corruption.
ACT|13|38||Know therefore, brethren, that through this man remission of sins is proclaimed to you.
ACT|13|39||And every one that believeth in this man, is made just from all things, from which ye could not be made just by the law of Moses.
ACT|13|40||Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you, which is written in the prophets:
ACT|13|41||Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though a man relate it to you.
ACT|13|42||And when they had gone from them, they besought them to speak the same things to them the next sabbath day.
ACT|13|43||And when the synagogue was dismissed, many Jews went after them, and likewise proselytes who feared God. And they conversed with them, and persuaded them to adhere to the grace of God.
ACT|13|44||And the next sabbath, the whole city assembled to hear the word of God.
ACT|13|45||And when the Jews saw the great assembly, they were filled with envy, and set themselves against the words which Paul spoke, and blasphemed.
ACT|13|46||And Paul and Barnabas said openly: To you first, ought the word of God to be spoken; but because ye repel it from you, and decide, against yourselves, that ye are not worthy of life eternal, lo, we turn ourselves to the Gentiles.
ACT|13|47||For so hath our Lord commanded us; as it is written: I have set thee a light to the Gentiles; that thou shouldst be for life unto the ends of the earth.
ACT|13|48||And when the Gentiles heard [this], they rejoiced and glorified God. And those believed, who were appointed to life eternal.
ACT|13|49||And the word of the Lord was talked of in all that region.
ACT|13|50||But the Jews stirred up the chiefs of the city, and the opulent women who with them feared God, and set up a persecution against Paul and against Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
ACT|13|51||And when they went out, they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and went to the city of Iconium.
ACT|13|52||And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT|14|1||And they came and entered into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke with them, that many of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.
ACT|14|2||But Jews of the class of unbelievers, excited the Gentiles, to maltreat the brethren.
ACT|14|3||And they continued there a long time, and spoke openly concerning the Lord; and he gave testimony to the word of his grace, by the signs and prodigies which he wrought by their hands.
ACT|14|4||And the whole multitude of the city was divided; and a part were with the Jews, and a part adhered to the legates.
ACT|14|5||And an assault was made on them, by the Gentiles, and by the Jews and their chiefs, to insult them, and to stone them with stones.
ACT|14|6||And when they knew [it], they departed and fled to the cities of Lycaonia and Lystra and Derbe, and to the villages around them;
ACT|14|7||and there they preached.
ACT|14|8||And a certain man dwelt in the city Lystra, who was afflicted in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked.
ACT|14|9||He heard Paul speak: and when Paul saw him, and knew that he had faith to live;
ACT|14|10||he said to him, with a loud voice: In the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, I say to thee, Rise upon thy feet. And he sprang up, stood, and walked.
ACT|14|11||And the assembly of people, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voice, and said, in the language of the country: The gods have assumed the likeness of men, and have come down to us.
ACT|14|12||And they named Barnabas the Lord of the Gods; and Paul Hermes, because he commenced the speaking.
ACT|14|13||And the priest of the Lord of the Gods, who was without the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gate of the court where they lodged, and was disposed to offer sacrifices to them.
ACT|14|14||But Barnabas and Paul, when they heard [it], rent their garments, and sprang and went among the throng,
ACT|14|15||and called out, and said: Men, what do ye? We also are frail mortals like yourselves, who preach to you, that ye should turn from these useless things, unto the living God, who made heaven and earth and seas, and whatever is in them.
ACT|14|16||He, in former ages, left all the nations to go in their own ways:
ACT|14|17||although he did not leave himself without testimony, while he did them good from heaven, and sent down the rain, and made the fruits to grow in their seasons, and filled their hearts with food and pleasure.
ACT|14|18||And, by saying these things, they with difficulty prevented the people from offering sacrifice to them.
ACT|14|19||But Jews came hither from Iconium and Antioch, and excited the people against them. And they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
ACT|14|20||And the disciples assembled around him; and he arose, and went into the city.---And the next day, he departed from there, with Barnabas; and they came to the city of Derbe.
ACT|14|21||And while they were preaching to the inhabitants of that city, they made many disciples. And turning back, they came to the city Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
ACT|14|22||confirming the souls of the disciples, and entreating them to persevere in the faith; and they told them, that it was necessary, through much affliction, to enter into the kingdom of God.
ACT|14|23||And they established for them Elders in each church, while they fasted with them, and prayed, and commended them to our Lord in whom they believed.
ACT|14|24||And when they had travelled over the region of Pisidia they came to Pamphylia.
ACT|14|25||And when they had spoken the word of the Lord in the city of Perga, they went down to Attalia.
ACT|14|26||And thence they proceeded by sea, and came to Antioch; because from there they had been commended to the grace of the Lord, for that work which they had accomplished.
ACT|14|27||And when they had collected together the whole church, they narrated all that God had wrought with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
ACT|14|28||And they remained there a long time with the disciples.
ACT|15|1||And certain men came down from Judaea, and taught the brethren, that unless ye be circumcised, in accordance with the rite of the law, ye cannot have life.
ACT|15|2||And Paul and Barnabas had much trouble and disputation with them. And it resulted, that Paul and Barnabas, and others with them, went up to the legates and Elders at Jerusalem, because of this matter.
ACT|15|3||And the church waited on them, and sent them away; and they travelled through all Phenicia and the territory of the Samaritans, narrating the conversion of the Gentiles, and causing great joy to all the brethren.
ACT|15|4||And when they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the Elders, and by the legates; and they recounted all that God had wrought by them.
ACT|15|5||And some who from the sect of the Pharisees had believed, rose up and said: It is necessary for you to circumcise them, and to command them to observe the law of Moses.
ACT|15|6||And the legates and Elders assembled, to look into this matter.
ACT|15|7||And when there had been much discussion, Simon arose and said to them: Men, brethren, ye know that, from the earlier days, God chose that from my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and should believe.
ACT|15|8||And God, who knoweth what is in hearts, bore testimony concerning them, and gave the Holy Spirit to them, even as to us.
ACT|15|9||And he made no distinction between them and us; because he purified their hearts by faith.
ACT|15|10||And now, why tempt ye God, by putting a yoke on the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we could bear?
ACT|15|11||But we believe, that we as well as they, are to have life by the grace of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|15|12||And the whole assembly were silent, and listened to Paul and Barnabas, who related how God by their hands had wrought signs and prodigies among the Gentiles.
ACT|15|13||And after they ceased, James arose and said: Men, brethren, hearken to me.
ACT|15|14||Simon hath related to you, how God hath begun to elect a people for his name from among the Gentiles.
ACT|15|15||And with this the words of the prophets accord, as it is written:
ACT|15|16||After these things I will return, and will set up the tabernacle of David that had fallen; and will build that which was in ruins in it, and will raise it up:
ACT|15|17||so that the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the nations on whom my name is called; saith the Lord, who doth all these things.
ACT|15|18||Known, from of old, are the works of God.
ACT|15|19||Therefore I say to you, let them not crush those who from among the Gentiles have turned unto God.
ACT|15|20||But let word be sent to them, that they keep aloof from the defilement of a sacrifice [to idols], and from whoredom, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
ACT|15|21||For in every city, from former ages, Moses hath heralds in the synagogues, who read him every sabbath.
ACT|15|22||Then the legates and Elders, with all the church, chose men from among themselves, and sent them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Jude, who was called Barsabas, and Silas, men who were chiefs among the brethren.
ACT|15|23||And they wrote a letter by them, thus: The legates and Elders and brethren, to them that are in Antioch, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, brethren who are from the Gentiles, greeting:
ACT|15|24||We have heard, that some have gone from us and disquieted you, by discourses, and have subverted your minds, by saying, That ye must be circumcised and keep the law; things which we have not commanded them.
ACT|15|25||Therefore we all have thought fit, when assembled, to choose and send men to you, with our beloved Paul and Barnabas,
ACT|15|26||men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|15|27||And we have sent with them Jude and Silas, that they may tell you the same things orally.
ACT|15|28||For it was pleasing to the Holy Spirit, and to us, that there should not be laid upon you any additional burden, besides these necessary things:
ACT|15|29||that ye keep aloof from a sacrifice [to idols], and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from whoredom. And if ye keep yourselves from these, ye will do well. Be ye steadfast in the Lord.
ACT|15|30||And they who were sent, came to Antioch, and assembled all the people, and delivered the letter.
ACT|15|31||And when they had read [it], they rejoiced and were comforted.
ACT|15|32||And with abundant discourse they strengthened the brethren; and the associates of Jude and Silas established them, because they also were prophets.
ACT|15|33||And when, they had been there some time, the brethren dismissed them in peace to the legates.
ACT|15|34||[But it was the pleasure of Silas to remain there.]
ACT|15|35||Paul also and Barnabas remained at Antioch; and they taught and proclaimed, with many others, the word of God.
ACT|15|36||And after [some] days, Paul said to Barnabas: Let us return, and visit the brethren in every city, in which we have preached the word of God; and let us see what they are doing.
ACT|15|37||And Barnabas was disposed to take John, who was surnamed Mark.
ACT|15|38||But Paul was not willing to take him with them; because he left them when they were in Pamphylia, and went not with them.
ACT|15|39||In, consequence of this strife, they separated from each other: and Barnabas took Mark, and they travelled by sea and went to Cyprus.
ACT|15|40||But Paul chose Silas for his companion, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.
ACT|15|41||And he travelled through Syria, and through Cilicia, and strengthened the churches.
ACT|16|1||And he came to the city Derbe, and to Lystra. And there was a certain disciple there, whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but his father was a Gentile.
ACT|16|2||And all the disciples of Lystra and Iconium gave good testimony of him.
ACT|16|3||Him Paul was disposed to take with him: and he took him, and circumcised him, because of the Jews that were in that region; for they all knew that his father was a Gentile.
ACT|16|4||And as they went among the cities, they preached and taught them, that they should observe those injunctions which the legates and Elders at Jerusalem had written.
ACT|16|5||And so were the churches established in the faith, and were increased in number daily.
ACT|16|6||And they travelled through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia; and the Holy Spirit forbid them to speak the word of God in Asia.
ACT|16|7||And when they came into the region of Mysia, they were disposed to go from there into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus permitted them not.
ACT|16|8||And when they departed from Mysia, they came down to the region of Troas.
ACT|16|9||And in a vision of the night, there appeared unto Paul, a man of Macedonia, who stood and besought him, saying: Come to Macedonia and help us.
ACT|16|10||And when Paul had seen this vision, immediately we were desirous to depart for Macedonia; because we inferred, that our Lord called us to preach to them.
ACT|16|11||And we sailed from Troas, and came direct to Samothrace; and from there, on the following day, we came to the city Neapolis.
ACT|16|12||And from there to Philippi, which is the chief [city] of Macedonia, and is a colony. And we remained in that city certain days.
ACT|16|13||And on the sabbath day, we went without the gate of the city to the side of a river, because a house of prayer was seen there. And when we were seated, we conversed with the women who there assembled.
ACT|16|14||And a certain woman who feared God, a seller of purple, whose name was Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, [was there]. Her heart our Lord opened, and she hearkened to what Paul spake.
ACT|16|15||And she was baptized, and her household. And she entreated us, saying: If ye are really persuaded that I have believed in our Lord, come and take lodging in my house. And she urged us much.
ACT|16|16||And it occurred that, as we were going to the house of prayer, a certain maid met us, who had a spirit of divination, and who procured for her lords great gain by the divination which she performed.
ACT|16|17||And she followed after Paul and us, and cried, saying: These men are the servants of the Most High God, and they announce to you the way of life.
ACT|16|18||And this she did many days. And Paul was indignant; and he said to that spirit, I command thee, in the name of Jesus Messiah, that thou come out of her. And it came out the same hour.
ACT|16|19||And when her lords saw that the prospect of their gain from her was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragging them along brought them to the market-place,
ACT|16|20||and set them before the prefects and chiefs of the city, and said: These men disturb our city; for they are Jews,
ACT|16|21||and they preach to us customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive and to practise, because we are Romans.
ACT|16|22||And a great company was collected against them. Then the prefects rent their garments, and commanded to scourge them.
ACT|16|23||And when they had scourged them much, they cast them into the prison, and commanded the keeper of the prison to keep them with care.
ACT|16|24||And he, having received this command, carried and immured them in the inner part of the prison, and confined their feet in the stocks.
ACT|16|25||And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and glorifying God: and the prisoners heard them.
ACT|16|26||And suddenly there was a great shaking, and the foundations of the prison were moved; and at once all the doors opened, and the bands of all were loosed.
ACT|16|27||And when the keeper of the prison awoke, and saw that the doors of the prison were open, he took a sword and sought to kill himself; because he supposed the prisoners had escaped.
ACT|16|28||But Paul called to him, in a loud voice, and said: Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.
ACT|16|29||And he lighted for himself a lamp, and sprang and came in, trembling, and fell at the feet of Paul and Silas.
ACT|16|30||And he brought them out, and said to them: My lords, what must I do, that I may have life?
ACT|16|31||And they said to him: Believe on the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, and thou wilt have life, thou and thy house.
ACT|16|32||And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all the members of his house.
ACT|16|33||And the same hour of the night, he took and washed them from their stripes; and he was baptized immediately, he and all the members of his house.
ACT|16|34||And he took them and brought them into his house, and set a table for them; and he rejoiced in the faith of God, he and all the members of his house.
ACT|16|35||And when it was morning, the prefects sent rod-bearers to say to the superior of the prison: Let those men loose.
ACT|16|36||And when the superior of the prison heard [it], he went in, and said the same thing to Paul; [namely], that the prefects have sent [word] that ye be set free. And now, [said he,] Go ye out, and depart in peace.
ACT|16|37||But Paul said to him: They have scourged us, unoffending men, and Romans, before all the world, and have cast us into prison; and now, do they secretly let us out? No, surely: but let them come themselves and bring us out.
ACT|16|38||And the rod-bearers went and told to the prefects the words which were told to them: and when they heard that they were Romans, they were afraid,
ACT|16|39||and came to them, and entreated of them that they would come out, and that they would leave the city.
ACT|16|40||And when they came out from the prison, they entered the house of Lydia; and there they saw the brethren, and comforted them, and departed.
ACT|17|1||And they passed through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, and came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.
ACT|17|2||And Paul, as was his custom, went in to them; and during three sabbaths he discoursed with them from the scriptures;
ACT|17|3||expounding and showing, that the Messiah was to suffer, and to arise from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I announce to you is the Messiah.
ACT|17|4||And some of them believed, and adhered to Paul and Silas; and of those Greeks who feared God, a great many; and also of noted women, not a few.
ACT|17|5||But the Jews were indignant, and gathered to themselves evil men from the marketplace of the city, and formed a great mob; and they alarmed the city, and came and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to draw them from it, and to deliver them up to the mob.
ACT|17|6||And when they found them not there, they drew Jason and the brethren who were there, and brought them before the chiefs of the city, crying out: These are they who have terrified all the country; and lo, they have come hither also:
ACT|17|7||and this Jason is their entertainer: and they all resist the commands of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.
ACT|17|8||And the chiefs of the city and all the people, were alarmed when they heard these things.
ACT|17|9||And they took sureties from Jason, and also from the brethren, and then released them.
ACT|17|10||And the brethren immediately, on the same night, sent away Paul and Silas to the city of Berea. And when they came there, they entered into the synagogue of the Jews.
ACT|17|11||For the Jews there were more liberal than the Jews of Thessalonica; and they gladly heard the word from them daily, and searched from the scriptures whether these things were so.
ACT|17|12||And many of them believed; and so likewise of the Greeks, many men, and women of note.
ACT|17|13||And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul in the city of Berea, they came thither also, and they ceased not to excite and alarm the people.
ACT|17|14||And the brethren sent away Paul, that he might go down to the sea. But Silas and Timothy abode in that city.
ACT|17|15||And they who conducted Paul, went with him to the city of Athens. And when they departed from him, they received an epistle from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him speedily.
ACT|17|16||And while Paul was waiting [for them] at Athens, he was pained in his spirit; because he saw that the whole city was full of idols.
ACT|17|17||And in the synagogue he spoke with the Jews, and with those that feared God, and in the market-place with them who daily assembled there.
ACT|17|18||And also philosophers of the sect of Epicureans, and others who were called Stoics, disputed with him. And one and another of them said: What doth this word-monger mean? Others said: He announceth foreign deities; because he preached to them Jesus and his resurrection.
ACT|17|19||And they took him and brought him to the place of judgments called Areopagus, and said to him: May we know what this new doctrine which thou preachest is?
ACT|17|20||For thou scatterest in our ears strange words; and we wish to know what they are.
ACT|17|21||For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there, cared for nothing else but to tell or to hear something new.
ACT|17|22||And as Paul stood in the Areopagus, he said: Men, Athenians, I perceive that in all things ye are excessive in the worship of demons.
ACT|17|23||For, as I was rambling about, and viewing the temples of your worship, I met with an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE HIDDEN GOD. Him, therefore, whom ye worship while ye know him not, the very same I announce to you.
ACT|17|24||For the God who made the world and all that is in it, and who is Lord of heaven and of earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.
ACT|17|25||Nor is he ministered to by human hands, neither hath he any wants; for he it is giveth life and breath to every man.
ACT|17|26||And of one blood hath he made the whole world of men, that they might dwell on the face of all the earth: and he hath separated the seasons by his ordinance; and hath set bounds to the residence of men:
ACT|17|27||that they might inquire and search after God, and, by means of his creations, might find him; because he is not afar off from each one of us:
ACT|17|28||for in him it is we live, and move, and exist: as one of your own wise men hath said: From him is our descent.
ACT|17|29||Therefore we, whose descent is from God, ought not to suppose that the Deity hath the likeness of gold, or silver, or stone, sculptured by the art and skill of men.
ACT|17|30||And the times of this error God hath made to pass away; and at the present time, he commandeth all men, that each individual, in every place, should repent.
ACT|17|31||Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge all the earth, with righteousness, by the man whom he hath designated: and he turneth every man to faith in him, in that he raised him from the dead.
ACT|17|32||And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some of them ridiculed, and others of them said: At another time, we will hear thee on this matter.
ACT|17|33||And so Paul departed from among them.
ACT|17|34||And some of them adhered to him, and believed; one of these was Dionysius from among the judges of Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
ACT|18|1||And when Paul departed from Athens, he went to Corinth.
ACT|18|2||And he found there a man, a Jew, whose name was Aquila, who was from the region of Pontus, and had just then arrived from the country of Italy, he and Priscilla his wife, because Claudius Caesar had commanded that all Jews should depart from Rome. And he went to them;
ACT|18|3||and, because he was of a their trade, he took lodgings with them, and worked with them; for by their trade they were tent-makers.
ACT|18|4||And he spoke in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and Gentiles.
ACT|18|5||And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was impeded in discourse, because the Jews stood up against him, and reviled, as he testified to them that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT|18|6||And he shook his garments, and said to them: Henceforth I am clean; I betake myself to the Gentiles.
ACT|18|7||And he went away, and entered into the house of a certain man named Titus, one who feared God, and whose house adjoined the synagogue.
ACT|18|8||And Crispus, the president of the synagogue, believed on our Lord, he and all the members of his house. And many Corinthians gave ear, and believed in God and were baptized.
ACT|18|9||And the Lord said to Paul in a vision: Fear not, but speak and be not silent:
ACT|18|10||for I am with thee, and no one is able to harm thee; and I have much people in this city.
ACT|18|11||And he resided in Corinth a year and six months, and taught them the word of God.
ACT|18|12||And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews assembled together against Paul; and they brought him before the judgment-seat,
ACT|18|13||saying: This man persuadeth the people to worship God contrary to the law.
ACT|18|14||And when Paul requested that he might open his mouth and speak, Gallio said to the Jews: If your accusation, O Jews, related to any wrong done, or any fraud, or base act, I would listen to you suitably.
ACT|18|15||But if the contests are about words, and about names, and concerning your law, ye must see to it among yourselves, for I am not disposed to be a judge of such matters.
ACT|18|16||And he repelled them from his judgment-seat.
ACT|18|17||And all the Gentiles laid hold of Sosthenes an Elder of the synagogue, and smote him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio disregarded these things.
ACT|18|18||And when Paul had been there many days, he bid adieu to the brethren, and departed by sea to go to Syria. And with him went Priscilla and Aquila, when he had shaved his head at Cenchrea, because he had vowed a vow.
ACT|18|19||And they came to Ephesus; and Paul entered the synagogue, and discoursed with the Jews.
ACT|18|20||And they requested him to tarry with them: but he could not be persuaded.
ACT|18|21||For he said: I must certainly keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem. But, if it please God, I will come again to you.
ACT|18|22||And Aquila and Priscilla he left at Ephesus, and he himself proceeded by sea and came to Caesarea. And he went up and saluted the members of the church, and went on to Antioch.
ACT|18|23||And when he had been there some days, he departed, and travelled from place to place in the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, establishing all the disciples.
ACT|18|24||And a certain man named Apollos, a Jew, a native of Alexandria, who was trained to eloquence, and well taught in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
ACT|18|25||He had been instructed in the ways of the Lord, and was fervent in spirit; and he discoursed and taught fully respecting Jesus, while yet he knew nothing except the baptism of John.
ACT|18|26||And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him to their house, and fully showed him the way of the Lord.
ACT|18|27||And when he was disposed to go to Achaia, the brethren anticipated him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. And, by going, through grace, he greatly assisted all them that believed.
ACT|18|28||For he reasoned powerfully against the Jews, before the congregation; and showed from the scriptures, respecting Jesus, that he is the Messiah.
ACT|19|1||And while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul travelled over the upper countries to Ephesus. And he inquired of the disciples whom he found there,
ACT|19|2||Have ye received the Holy Spirit, since ye believed? They answered and said to him: If there be a Holy Spirit, it hath not come to our hearing.
ACT|19|3||He said to them: Into what then were ye baptized? They say: Into the baptism of John.
ACT|19|4||Paul said to them: John baptized the people with the baptism of repentance, while he told them to believe in him who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus the Messiah.
ACT|19|5||And when they heard these things, they were baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|19|6||And Paul laid [his] hand on them; and the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in various tongues, and prophesied.
ACT|19|7||And all the persons were twelve.
ACT|19|8||And Paul entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly three months, persuading in regard to the kingdom of God.
ACT|19|9||And some of them were hardened, and disputatious, and reviled the way of God before the assembly of the people. Then Paul withdrew himself, and separated the disciples from them. And he discoursed with them daily in the school of a man named Tyrannus.
ACT|19|10||And this continued for two years, until all who resided in [Proconsular] Asia, both Jews and Gentiles, heard the word of the Lord.
ACT|19|11||And God wrought very great miracles by the hand of Paul:
ACT|19|12||so that, from the clothes on his body, napkins and rags were carried and laid upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and demons also went out.
ACT|19|13||And moreover certain Jews, who went about exorcising demons, were disposed to exorcise in the name of our Lord Jesus over those who had unclean spirits, by saying: We adjure you, in the name of that Jesus whom Paul announceth.
ACT|19|14||And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, who did this.
ACT|19|15||And the evil demon answered and said to them: Jesus I well know, and Paul I know, but as for you, who are ye?
ACT|19|16||And the man in whom was the evil demon leaped upon them, and overpowered them, and threw them down: and they fled out of the house denuded and bruised.
ACT|19|17||And this became known to all the Jews and Gentiles, who resided at Ephesus. And fear fell on them all, and the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah was exalted.
ACT|19|18||And many of them that believed, came and narrated their faults, and confessed what they had done.
ACT|19|19||And also many magicians collected their books, and brought and burned them before every body: and they computed the cost of them, and it amounted to fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.
ACT|19|20||And thus with great power was the faith of God strengthened and increased.
ACT|19|21||And when these things had been accomplished, Paul purposed in his mind, to make the circuit of all Macedonia and Achaia, and [then] go to Jerusalem. And he said: After I have gone thither, I must also see Rome.
ACT|19|22||And he sent two persons, of those that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia; but he himself remained for a time in Asia.
ACT|19|23||And at that time there was great commotion respecting the way of God.
ACT|19|24||For a certain silversmith was there, named Demetrius, who made silver shrines for Diana, and afforded great profits to the artisans of his trade.
ACT|19|25||He assembled all the artisans of his trade, and those who labored with them, and said to them: Gentlemen, ye know that our gains are all from this manufacture.
ACT|19|26||And ye also know and see, that not only the citizens of Ephesus, but also the mass of all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and enticed away, by saying, that those are not gods, which are made by the hands of men.
ACT|19|27||And not only is this occupation slandered and impeded, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana is accounted as nothing; and likewise the goddess herself of all Asia, and whom all nations worship, is contemned.
ACT|19|28||And when they heard these things they were filled with wrath; and they cried out, and said: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT|19|29||And the whole city was in commotion; and they ran together, and entered the theatre. And they caught, and bore along with them, Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and associates of Paul.
ACT|19|30||And Paul was disposed to go into the theatre: but the disciples restrained him.
ACT|19|31||And likewise the chiefs of Asia, because they were his friends, sent and requested of him, that he would not expose himself by going into the theatre.
ACT|19|32||And the multitudes that were in the theatre were in great confusion, and cried, some one thing, and some another: and many of them knew not for what cause they had come together.
ACT|19|33||And the Jewish people who were there, brought forward one of their men, a Jew, named Alexander. And he, rising up, waved his hand, and wished to make a defence before the people.
ACT|19|34||But they knowing him to be a Jew, all cried out with one voice, about two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT|19|35||But the chief of the city tranquillized them, by saying: Men of Ephesus, What person is there, among men, who doth not know the city of the Ephesians to be devoted to the worship of the great Diana, and of her image that descended from heaven?
ACT|19|36||Since therefore no one can gainsay this, ye ought to be tranquil, and to do nothing with precipitancy.
ACT|19|37||For ye have brought forward these men, when they have robbed no temples, and have not reviled our goddess.
ACT|19|38||But if Demetrius and the men of his trade have a controversy with any one, lo, there is a proconsul in the city, they are men of dexterity, let them approach and litigate with one another.
ACT|19|39||Or if you desire any other thing, it may be determined in the place assigned by law for an assembly.
ACT|19|40||Because too we are now in danger of being accused as seditious, since we cannot give a reason for the meeting of this day, because we have assembled needlessly, and been tumultuous without a cause.
ACT|19|41||And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT|20|1||And after the tumult had subsided, Paul called the disciples to him, and comforted them, and kissed them, and departed, and went into Macedonia.
ACT|20|2||And when he had travelled over those regions, and had comforted them with many discourses, he proceeded to the country of Greece.
ACT|20|3||And he was there three months. And the Jews formed a plot against him, when he was about to go to Syria: and he contemplated returning to Macedonia.
ACT|20|4||And there departed with him, as far as Asia, Sopater of the city Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus who were of Thessalonica, and Gaius who was of the city of Derbe, and Timothy of Lystra, and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.
ACT|20|5||These proceeded on before us, and waited for us at Troas.
ACT|20|6||And we departed from Philippi, a city of the Macedonians, after the days of unleavened bread; and proceeded by water and arrived at Troas in five days, and remained there seven days.
ACT|20|7||And on the first day of the week, when we assembled to break the eucharist, Paul discoursed with them, because he was to depart the next day; and he continued his discourse till midnight.
ACT|20|8||And there were many lamps burning in the chamber where we were assembled.
ACT|20|9||And a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window and listening. And while Paul prolonged his discourse, he sunk into a deep sleep; and, in his sleep, he fell from the third loft, and was taken up as dead.
ACT|20|10||And Paul went down, and bent over him and embraced him, and said: Be not agitated, for his soul is in him.
ACT|20|11||And when he had gone up, he broke the bread and tasted [it], and discoursed until the morning dawned. And then he departed to go by land.
ACT|20|12||And they brought the young man alive, and rejoiced over him greatly.
ACT|20|13||And we went on board the ship, and sailed to the port of Thesos; because, there we were to take in Paul: for so had he bidden us, when he proceeded on by land.
ACT|20|14||And when we had received him at Thesos, we took him on board ship and proceeded to Mitylene.
ACT|20|15||And from there, the next day, we sailed over against the island Chios; and again, the next day we arrived at Samos, and stopped at Trogyllium; and on the following day we arrived at Miletus.
ACT|20|16||For Paul had determined with himself to pass by Ephesus, lest he should be delayed there; because he hasted on, if possible, to keep the day of pentecost in Jerusalem.
ACT|20|17||And from Miletus, he sent and called the Elders of the church at Ephesus.
ACT|20|18||And when they had come to him, he said to them: Ye yourselves know, how, at all times, since the first day that I entered Asia, I have been with you;
ACT|20|19||laboring for God, in great humility, and with tears, amid the trials which beset me from the plottings of Jews:
ACT|20|20||and I shunned not that which was advantageous to your souls, that I might preach to you, and teach in the streets and in houses,
ACT|20|21||while I testified to Jews and to Gentiles, as to repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|20|22||And now I am bound in spirit, and I go to Jerusalem; and I know not what will befall me there;
ACT|20|23||except that the Holy Spirit in every city, testifieth to me and saith: Bonds and afflictions await thee.
ACT|20|24||But my life is accounted by me as nothing, so that I may but finish my course, and the ministration which I have received from our Lord Jesus, to bear testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
ACT|20|25||And now, I know that ye will see my face no more, all of you among whom I have travelled and preached the kingdom of God.
ACT|20|26||I therefore protest to you, this day, that I am pure from the blood of you all.
ACT|20|27||For I have not shunned to acquaint you with all the will of God.
ACT|20|28||Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit hath established you bishops; that ye feed the church of God, which he hath acquired by his blood.
ACT|20|29||For I know, that after I am gone, fierce wolves will come in among you, and will have no mercy on the flock.
ACT|20|30||And also, from among yourselves, there will rise up men speaking perverse things, that they may turn away the disciples to go after them.
ACT|20|31||Therefore be ye vigilant; and remember, that for three years I ceased not to admonish each one of you, by day and by night, with tears.
ACT|20|32||And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the saints.
ACT|20|33||Silver, or gold, or garments, I have not coveted.
ACT|20|34||And ye yourselves, know, that these hands ministered to my wants, and to them that were with me.
ACT|20|35||And I have showed you all things; that thus it is a duty to labor, and to care for the infirm, and to remember the words of our Lord Jesus; for he hath said, That he is more blessed who giveth, than he who receiveth.
ACT|20|36||And when he had said these things, he fell on his knees and prayed, and all the people with him.
ACT|20|37||And there was great weeping among them all. And they embraced him, and kissed him.
ACT|20|38||And they had the most anguish, because of the word he uttered, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
ACT|21|1||And we separated from them, and proceeded in a straight course to the island of Coos: and the next day, we reached Rhodes, and from there Patara.
ACT|21|2||And we found there a ship going to Phenicia; and we entered it, and proceeded on.
ACT|21|3||And we came up with the island of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left we came to Syria; and from there we went to Tyre, for there the ship was to discharge her cargo.
ACT|21|4||And, as we found disciples there, we tarried with them seven days: and they, by the Spirit, told Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
ACT|21|5||And after those days, we departed and went on [our] way; and they all clung to us, they and their wives and their children, until [we were] without the city; and they fell on their knees by the seaside, and prayed.
ACT|21|6||And we kissed one another: and we embarked in the ship, and they returned to their homes.
ACT|21|7||And we sailed from Tyre, and arrived at the city Acco; and we saluted the brethren there, and stopped with them one day.
ACT|21|8||And the next day, we departed and came to Cesarea; and we went in and put up in the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was one of the seven.
ACT|21|9||He had four virgin daughters, who were prophetesses.
ACT|21|10||And as we were there many days, a certain prophet came down from Judaea, whose name was Agabus.
ACT|21|11||And he came in to us, and took the girdle of Paul's loins, and bound his own feet and hands, and said: Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man, who owns this girdle; and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
ACT|21|12||And when we heard these words, we and the residents of the place begged of him, that he would not go to Jerusalem.
ACT|21|13||Then Paul answered and said: What do ye, weeping and crushing my heart? For I am prepared, not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ACT|21|14||And as he was not to be persuaded by us, we desisted; and we said: Let the pleasure of our Lord take place.
ACT|21|15||And after those days, we prepared ourselves and went up to Jerusalem.
ACT|21|16||And some disciples of Caesarea went along with us, taking with them a brother from among the earlier disciples, whose name was Mnason, and who was from Cyprus; that he might entertain us at his house.
ACT|21|17||And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us joyfully.
ACT|21|18||And the next day, with Paul, we went unto James, when all the Elders were with him.
ACT|21|19||And we gave them salutation: and Paul narrated to them, with particularity what God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
ACT|21|20||And when they heard [it] they glorified God. And they said to him: Our brother, Thou seest how many myriads there are in Judaea who have believed: and these are all zealous for the law.
ACT|21|21||And it hath been told them, of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, by telling them not to circumcise their children, and not to observe the rites of the law.
ACT|21|22||Now, because they have heard that thou hast arrived here,
ACT|21|23||do thou what we tell thee. We have four men, who have vowed to purify themselves.
ACT|21|24||Take them, and go and purify thyself with them, and pay the expenses along with them, as they shall shave their heads; that every one may know, that what is said against thee is false, and that thou fulfillest and observest the law.
ACT|21|25||As to those of the Gentiles who have believed, we have written, that they should keep themselves from [an idol's] sacrifice, and from whoredom, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
ACT|21|26||Then Paul took those men, on the following day, and was purified with them; and he entered and went into the temple, manifesting to them the completion of the days of the purification, up to the presentation of the offering by each of them.
ACT|21|27||And when the seventh day arrived, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple: and they excited all the people against him, and laid hands on him,
ACT|21|28||crying out and saying: Men, sons of Israel; help. This is the man, who teacheth in every place, against our people, and against the law, and against this place; and he hath also brought Gentiles into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
ACT|21|29||For they had previously seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian; and they supposed, that he had entered the temple with Paul.
ACT|21|30||And the whole city was in commotion; and all the people assembled together, and laid hold of Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and instantly the gates were closed.
ACT|21|31||And while the multitude were seeking to kill him, it was reported to the Chiliarch of the cohort, that the whole city was in uproar.
ACT|21|32||And immediately he took a centurion and many soldiers, and they ran upon them. And when they saw the Chiliarch and the soldiers, they desisted from beating Paul.
ACT|21|33||And the Chiliarch came up to him, and seized him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains: and he inquired respecting him, who he was, and what he had done.
ACT|21|34||And persons from the throng vociferated against him this thing and that. And, because he could not, on account of their clamor, learn what the truth was, he commanded to conduct him to the castle.
ACT|21|35||And when Paul came to the stairs, the soldiers bore him along, because of the violence of the people.
ACT|21|36||For a great many people followed after him, and cried out, saying: Away with him.
ACT|21|37||And when he came near to entering the castle, Paul said to the Chiliarch: Wilt thou permit me to speak with thee? And he said to him: Dost thou know Greek?
ACT|21|38||Art not thou that Egyptian who, before these days, madest insurrection, and leadest out into the desert four thousand men, doers of evil?
ACT|21|39||Paul said to him: I am a Jew, a man of Tarsus, a noted city in Cilicia, in which I was born: I pray thee, suffer me to speak to the people.
ACT|21|40||And when he permitted him, Paul stood upon the stairs, and waved to them his hand; and when they were quiet, he addressed them in Hebrew, and said to them:
ACT|22|1||Brethren, and fathers, hearken to my defence before you.
ACT|22|2||And when they perceived that he addressed them in Hebrew, they were the more quiet: and he said to them:
ACT|22|3||I am a man who am a Jew; and I was born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but was brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed perfectly in the law of our fathers; and I was zealous for God, as ye also all are.
ACT|22|4||And I persecuted this way, even to death; for I bound, and delivered up to prison, [both] men and women.
ACT|22|5||As the high priest is my witness, and likewise all the Elders; from whom I received letters, that I might go to the brethren in Damascus, and bring those who were there prisoners to Jerusalem, to receive capital punishment.
ACT|22|6||And as I travelled and began to approach Damascus, at noonday, from amidst tranquillity, a great light from heaven burst upon me.
ACT|22|7||And I fell to the earth: and I heard a voice, which said to me: Saul, Saul! why persecutest thou me?
ACT|22|8||And I answered and said: Who art thou, my Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus the Nazarean, whom thou persecutest.
ACT|22|9||And the men who were with me, saw the light, but heard not the voice that talked with me.
ACT|22|10||And I said: My Lord, what must I do? And our Lord said to me: Arise, go to Damascus; and there will be told thee, all that it is commanded thee to do.
ACT|22|11||And as I could see nothing, because of the glory of that light, those with me took me by the hand, and I entered Damascus.
ACT|22|12||And a certain man, Ananias, who was upright according to the law, as all the Jews there testified concerning him, came to me.
ACT|22|13||And he said to me: My brother Saul! open thine eyes. And instantly my eyes were opened; and I looked upon him.
ACT|22|14||And he said to me: The God of our fathers hath ordained thee to know his will, and to behold the Just One, and to hear the voice of his mouth.
ACT|22|15||And thou shalt be a witness for him before all men, concerning all that thou hast seen and heard.
ACT|22|16||And now, why delayest thou? Arise, be baptized, and be cleansed from thy sins, while thou invokest his name.
ACT|22|17||And I returned and came hither to Jerusalem. And I prayed in the temple.
ACT|22|18||And I saw him in a vision, when he said to me: Make haste, and get thee out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
ACT|22|19||And I said: My Lord, they well know that I have delivered up to prison, and have scourged in all synagogues, those who believed in thee.
ACT|22|20||And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing with them, and performed the pleasure of his slayers, and took charge of the garments of those that stoned him.
ACT|22|21||But he said to me: Depart; for I send thee afar, to preach to the Gentiles.
ACT|22|22||And when they had heard Paul as far as this sentence, they raised their voice, and cried out: Away with such a man from the earth! for he ought not to live!
ACT|22|23||And as they vociferated, and cast off their garments, and threw dust into the air,
ACT|22|24||the Chiliarch gave orders, to carry him into the castle: and he commanded, that he should be examined with stripes; that he might know, for what cause they cried out against him.
ACT|22|25||And as they were stretching him with ropes, Paul said to the centurion who stood over him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man, who is a Roman, and not yet found guilty?
ACT|22|26||And when the centurion heard [it], he went to the Chiliarch, and said to him: What doest thou? For this man is a Roman.
ACT|22|27||And the Chiliarch came to him, and said to him: Tell me; Art thou a Roman? And he said to him: Yes.
ACT|22|28||The Chiliarch replied and said to him: With much money I acquired Roman citizenship. Paul said to him: And I was born in it.
ACT|22|29||And immediately they who were intending to scourge him, fled from him: and the Chiliarch was afraid, when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had stretched him [for scourging].
ACT|22|30||And the next day, he wished to know truly what the accusation was, which the Jews brought against him: and he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests, and the whole company of their head-men, to assemble; and he took Paul, and brought him down, and placed him among them.
ACT|23|1||And when Paul had looked on the assembly of them, he said: Men, my brethren; I have lived in all good conscience before God up to this day.
ACT|23|2||And Ananias, the priest, commanded those who stood by his side, to smite Paul on the mouth.
ACT|23|3||And Paul said to him: God is hereafter to smite thee, [thou] Whited Wall! For, sittest thou judging me agreeably to law, while thou transgressest the law, and commandest to smite me?
ACT|23|4||And those standing by, said to him: Dost thou reproach the priest of God!
ACT|23|5||Paul said to them: I was not aware, my brethren, that he was the priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not curse the ruler of thy people.
ACT|23|6||And, as Paul knew that a part of the people were of the Sadducees, and a part of the Pharisees, he cried out, in the assembly: Men, my brethren; I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; and for the hope of the resurrection of the dead, I am judged.
ACT|23|7||And when he had said this, the Pharisees and Sadducees fell upon one another, and the people were divided.
ACT|23|8||For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor a spirit: but the Pharisees confess all these.
ACT|23|9||And there was great vociferation. And some Scribes of the party of the Pharisees rose up, and contended with them, and said. We have found nothing evil in this man: for if a spirit or an angel hath conversed with him, what is there in that?
ACT|23|10||And, as there was great commotion among them, the Chiliarch was afraid lest they should tear Paul in pieces. And he sent Romans, to go and pluck him from their midst, and bring him into the castle.
ACT|23|11||And when night came, our Lord appeared to Paul, and said to him: Be strong; for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so also art thou to testify at Rome.
ACT|23|12||And when it was morning, several of the Jews assembled together, and bound themselves by imprecations that they would neither eat nor drink until they had slain Paul.
ACT|23|13||And they who had established this compact by oath, were more than forty persons.
ACT|23|14||And they went to the priests and Elders, and said: We have bound ourselves by imprecations, that we will taste of nothing, until we shall have slain Paul.
ACT|23|15||And now, do ye and the chiefs of the congregation request of the Chiliarch, that he would bring him unto you, as if ye were desirous to investigate truly his conduct: and we are prepared to slay him, ere he shall come to you.
ACT|23|16||And the son of Paul's sister, heard of this plot: and he went into the castle, and informed Paul.
ACT|23|17||And Paul sent and called one of the centurions, and said to him: Conduct this youth to the Chiliarch; for he hath something to tell him.
ACT|23|18||And the centurion took the young man, and introduced him to the Chiliarch, and said: Paul the prisoner called me, and requested me to bring this youth to thee, for he hath something to tell thee.
ACT|23|19||And the Chiliarch took the young man by his hand, and led him one side, and asked him: What hast thou to tell me?
ACT|23|20||And the young man said to him: The Jews have projected to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow to their assembly, as if wishing to learn something more from him.
ACT|23|21||But be not thou persuaded by them: for, lo, more than forty persons of them watch for him in ambush, and have bound themselves by imprecations, that they will neither eat nor drink until they shall have slain him: and lo, they are prepared, and are waiting for thy promise.
ACT|23|22||And the Chiliarch dismissed the young man, after charging him: Let no man know, that thou hast showed me these things.
ACT|23|23||And he called two centurions, and said to them: Go and prepare two hundred Romans to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and shooters with the right hand two hundred; and let them set out at the third hour of the night.
ACT|23|24||And provide also a saddle beast, that they may set Paul on it, and carry him safely to Felix the governor.
ACT|23|25||And he wrote a letter and gave them, in which was, thus:
ACT|23|26||Claudius Lysias to the excellent governor Felix; greeting.
ACT|23|27||The Jews seized this man, in order to kill him; but I came with Romans, and rescued him, when I learned that he was a Roman.
ACT|23|28||And as I wished to know the offence, for which they criminated him, I brought him to their assembly.
ACT|23|29||And I found, that it was about questions of their law they accused him, and that an offence worthy of bonds or of death, was not upon him.
ACT|23|30||And when the wiles of a plot formed by the Jews against him came to my knowledge, I forthwith sent him to thee. And I have directed his accusers, to go and contend with him, before thee. Farewell.
ACT|23|31||Then the Romans, as they had been commanded, took Paul by night, and brought him to the city of Antipatris.
ACT|23|32||And the next day, the horsemen dismissed the footmen their associates, that they might return to the castle.
ACT|23|33||And they brought him to Caesarea: and they delivered the letter to the governor, and set Paul before him.
ACT|23|34||And when he had read the letter, he asked him of what province he was? And when he learned that he was of Cilicia,
ACT|23|35||he said to him: I will give thee audience, when thy accusers arrive. And he ordered him to be kept in the Praetorium of Herod.
ACT|24|1||And after five days, Ananias the high priest, with the Elders, and with Tertullus the orator, went down, and made a communication to the governor against Paul.
ACT|24|2||And when he had been called, Tertullus began to accuse him, and to say: Through thee, we dwell in much tranquillity; and many reforms have come to this nation, under thy administration;
ACT|24|3||and we all, in every place, receive thy grace, excellent Felix.
ACT|24|4||But, not to weary thee with numerous [particulars], I pray thee to hear our humbleness, in brief.
ACT|24|5||For we have found this man to be an assassin, and a mover of sedition among all Jews in the whole land: for he is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazareans.
ACT|24|6||And he was disposed to pollute our temple. And having seized him we wished to judge him according to our law.
ACT|24|7||But Lysias the Chiliarch came, and with great violence took him out of our hands, and sent him to thee.
ACT|24|8||And he commanded his accusers to come before thee. And if thou wilt interrogate him, thou canst learn from him respecting all these things of which we accuse him.
ACT|24|9||And the Jews also pleaded against him, saying that these things were so.
ACT|24|10||Then the governor made signs to Paul, that he should speak. And Paul answered and said: I know thee to have been a judge of this nation for many years, and I therefore cheerfully enter upon a defence of myself.
ACT|24|11||Because thou canst understand, that there have been but twelve days, since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
ACT|24|12||And they did not find me talking with any person in the temple, nor collecting any company, either in their synagogues, or in the city.
ACT|24|13||Nor have they the power to prove, before thee, the things of which they now accuse me.
ACT|24|14||But this indeed I acknowledge, that in that same doctrine of which they speak, I do serve the God of my fathers, believing all the things written in the law and in the prophets.
ACT|24|15||And I have a hope in God, which they also themselves expect,---that there is to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the wicked.
ACT|24|16||And for this reason, I also labor to have always a pure conscience before God, and before men.
ACT|24|17||And, after many years, I came to the people of my own nation, to impart alms, and to present an offering.
ACT|24|18||And when I had purified myself, these men found me in the temple; not with a throng, nor with a tumult.
ACT|24|19||But certain Jews, who came from Asia, were tumultuous; who ought, with me, to stand before thee, and make accusation of their own affair.
ACT|24|20||Or let these here present say, whether they found any offence in me, when I stood before their assembly;
ACT|24|21||except this one thing, that I cried, while standing in the midst of them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead, am I this day on trial before you.
ACT|24|22||And Felix, because he understood that way fully, deferred them, saying: When the Chiliarch shall come, I will give hearing between you.
ACT|24|23||And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, at rest; and that no one of his acquaintances should be forbidden to minister to him.
ACT|24|24||And after a few days, Felix, and Drusilla his wife who was a Jewess, sent and called for Paul; and they heard him concerning faith in the Messiah.
ACT|24|25||And while he was discoursing with them on righteousness, and on holiness, and on the future judgment, Felix was filled with fear; and he said: For the present time, go: and when I have opportunity, I will send for thee.
ACT|24|26||He hoped, moreover, that a present would be given him by Paul; [and] therefore, he often sent for him, and conversed with him.
ACT|24|27||And when two years were fulfilled to him, another governor, whose name was Porcius Festus, came into his place. And Felix, that he might do the Jews a favor, left Paul a prisoner.
ACT|25|1||And when Festus arrived at Caesarea, he, after three days, went up to Jerusalem.
ACT|25|2||And the chief priests and the head men of the Jews made representations to him concerning Paul.
ACT|25|3||And they petitioned him, asking of him the favor, that he would send for him to come to Jerusalem; they placing an ambush to slay him by the way.
ACT|25|4||But Festus made answer: Paul is in custody at Caesarea, whither I am in haste to go.
ACT|25|5||Therefore, let those among you who are able, go down with us, and make presentment of every offence there is in the man.
ACT|25|6||And when he had been there eight or ten days, he came down to Caesarea. And the next day, he sat on the tribunal, and commanded Paul to be brought.
ACT|25|7||And when he came, the Jews who had come from Jerusalem surrounded him, and preferred against him many and weighty charges, which they were unable to substantiate.
ACT|25|8||Meanwhile Paul maintained, that he had committed no offence, either against the Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.
ACT|25|9||But Festus, because he was disposed to conciliate the favor of the Jews, said to Paul: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried before me for these things?
ACT|25|10||Paul replied, and said: I stand before Caesar's tribunal: here I ought to be tried. Against the Jews I have committed no offence, as thou also well knowest.
ACT|25|11||If I had committed any crime, or done any thing worthy of death, I would not refuse to die. But if none of the things of which they accuse me, is upon me, no one may sacrifice me to their pleasure. I announce an appeal to Caesar.
ACT|25|12||Then Festus conferred with his counsellors, and said: Hast thou declared an appeal to Caesar? Unto Caesar shalt thou go.
ACT|25|13||And when [some] days had passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea to salute Festus.
ACT|25|14||And when they had been with him: [some] days, Festus related to the king the case of Paul, saying: A certain man was left a prisoner by Felix:
ACT|25|15||And when I was at Jerusalem, the: chief priests and the Elders of the Jews informed me respecting him, and desired that I would pass judgment upon him in their favor.
ACT|25|16||And I told them, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up a man gratuitously to be slain; until his accuser appeareth and chargeth him to his face, and opportunity is afforded him to make defence respecting what is charged upon him.
ACT|25|17||And: when I had come hither, without delay, I the next day sat on the tribunal, and commanded the man to be brought before me.
ACT|25|18||And his accusers stood up with him; and they were not able to substantiate any criminal charge against him, as I had expected;
ACT|25|19||but they had certain controversies with him respecting their worship, and respecting one Jesus, who died, but who, as Paul said, was alive.
ACT|25|20||And because I was not well established in regard to these questions, I said to Paul: Dost thou ask to go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters?
ACT|25|21||But he requested to be reserved for a trial before Caesar: and I ordered him to be kept, till I could send him to Caesar.
ACT|25|22||And Agrippa said: I should like to hear that man. And Festus said: To-morrow thou shalt hear him.
ACT|25|23||And the next day, came Agrippa and Bernice, with great pomp, and entered the house of trials, with the Chiliarchs and chiefs of the city: and Festus commanded, and Paul came.
ACT|25|24||And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all persons present with us; concerning this man whom ye see, all the people of the Jews applied to me, at Jerusalem and also here, crying out, that he ought no longer to live.
ACT|25|25||Yet on investigation, I found that he hath done nothing deserving death. But, because he requested to be reserved for the hearing of Caesar, I have ordered him to be sent.
ACT|25|26||And I know not what I can write to Caesar, in regard to him: and therefore I wished to bring him before you, and especially before thee, king Agrippa; that when his case shall have been heard, I may find what to write.
ACT|25|27||For it is unsuitable, when we send up a prisoner, not to designate his offence.
ACT|26|1||And Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak in thy own behalf. Then Paul extended his hand, and made defence, saying:
ACT|26|2||In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I consider myself highly favored, that I may this day make defence before thee:
ACT|26|3||especially, as I know thee to be expert in all the controversies and laws of the Jews. I therefore request thee to hear me with indulgence.
ACT|26|4||The Jews themselves, if they would testify, know well my course of life from my childhood, which from the beginning was among my nation and in Jerusalem.
ACT|26|5||For they have long been persuaded of me, and have known, that I lived in the princely doctrine of the Pharisees.
ACT|26|6||And now, for the hope of the promise which was made by God to our fathers, I stand and am judged.
ACT|26|7||To this hope, our twelve tribes hope to come, with earnest prayers by day and by night: and for this same hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
ACT|26|8||How judge ye? Are we not to believe, that God will raise the dead?
ACT|26|9||For I myself, at first, resolved in my own mind, that I would perpetrate many adverse things against the name of Jesus the Nazarean.
ACT|26|10||Which I also did at Jerusalem; and by the authority I received from the chief priests, I cast many of the saints into prison and when they were put to death by them, I took part with those that condemned them.
ACT|26|11||And in every synagogue I tortured them, while I pressed them to become revilers of the name of Jesus. And in the great wrath, with which I was filled against them, I also went to other cities to persecute them.
ACT|26|12||And, as I was going for this purpose to Damascus, with the authority and license of the chief priests,
ACT|26|13||at mid-day, on the road, I saw, O king, a light exceeding that of the sun, beaming from heaven upon me, and upon all those with me.
ACT|26|14||And we all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice, which said to me, in Hebrew: Saul, Saul! why persecutest thou me? It will be a hard thing for thee to kick against the goads.
ACT|26|15||And I said: My Lord, who art thou? And our Lord said to me: I am Jesus the Nazarean, whom thou persecutest.
ACT|26|16||And he said to me: Stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee, for this purpose, to constitute thee a minister and a witness of this thy seeing me, and of thy seeing me hereafter.
ACT|26|17||And I will deliver thee from the people of the Jews, and from other nations; to whom I send thee,
ACT|26|18||to open their eyes; that they may turn from darkness to the light, and from the dominion of Satan unto God; and may receive remission of sins, and a portion with the saints, by faith in me.
ACT|26|19||Wherefore, king Agrippa, I did not contumaciously withstand the heavenly vision:
ACT|26|20||but I preached from the first to them in Damascus, and to them in Jerusalem and in all the villages of Judaea; and I preached also to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and should turn to God, and should do the works suitable to repentance.
ACT|26|21||And on account of these things, the Jews seized me in the temple, and sought to kill me.
ACT|26|22||But unto this day God hath helped me; and lo, I stand and bear testimony, to the small and to the great; yet saying nothing aside from Moses and the prophets, but the very things which they declared were to take place:
ACT|26|23||[namely,] that Messiah would suffer, and would become the first fruits of the resurrection from the dead; and that he would proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.
ACT|26|24||And when Paul had extended his defence thus far, Festus cried, with a loud voice: Paul, thou art deranged: much study hath deranged thee.
ACT|26|25||Paul replied to him: I am not deranged, excellent Festus; but speak words of truth and rectitude.
ACT|26|26||And king Agrippa is also well acquainted with these things; and I therefore speak confidently before him, because I suppose not one of these things hath escaped his knowledge; for they were not done in secret.
ACT|26|27||King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
ACT|26|28||King Agrippa said to him: Almost, thou persuadest me to become a Christian.
ACT|26|29||And Paul said: I would to God, that not only thou, but likewise all that hear me this day, were almost, and altogether, as I am, aside from these bonds.
ACT|26|30||And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
ACT|26|31||And when they had gone out, they conversed with one another, and said: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT|26|32||And Agrippa said to Festus: The man might be set at liberty, if he had not announced an appeal to Caesar.
ACT|27|1||And Festus commanded, respecting him, that he should be sent to Italy, unto Caesar. And he delivered Paul, and other prisoners with him, to a certain man, a centurion of the Augustan cohort, whose name was Julius.
ACT|27|2||And when we were to depart, we embarked in a ship which was from the city of Adramyttium, and was going to the country of Asia. And there embarked with us in the ship, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of the city of Thessalonica.
ACT|27|3||And the next day, we arrived at Zidon. And the centurion treated Paul with kindness, and permitted him to visit his friends and be refreshed.
ACT|27|4||And on sailing from there, because the winds were against us, we sailed around to Cyprus.
ACT|27|5||And we passed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, and arrived at Myra, a city of Lycia.
ACT|27|6||And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, which was going to Italy; and he set us on board of it.
ACT|27|7||And as it was hard navigating, we had scarcely arrived, after many days, over against the isle of Cnidos. And, because the wind would not allow us to pursue a straight course, we sailed around by Crete, [and came] opposite the city of Salmone.
ACT|27|8||And with difficulty, after sailing about it, we arrived at a place called the Fair Havens, near to which was the city called Lassa.
ACT|27|9||And we were there a long time, and till after the day of the Jewish fast. And it was hazardous [then] for any one to go by sea; and Paul counselled them,
ACT|27|10||and said: Men, I perceive that our voyage will be [attended] with peril, and with much loss, not only of the cargo of our ship, but also of our lives.
ACT|27|11||But the centurion listened to the pilot, and to the owner of the ship, more than to the words of Paul.
ACT|27|12||And, because that harbor was not commodious for wintering in, many of us were desirous to sail from it, and if possible, to reach and to winter in a certain harbor of Crete, which was called Phenice, and which opened towards the south.
ACT|27|13||And when the south wind breezed up, and they hoped to arrive as they desired, we began to sail around Crete.
ACT|27|14||And shortly after, a tempest of wind arose upon us, called Typhonic Euroclydon.
ACT|27|15||And the ship was whirled about by the wind, and could not keep head to it; and we resigned [the ship] to its power.
ACT|27|16||And when we had passed a certain island, called Cyra, we could hardly retain the boat.
ACT|27|17||And after hoisting it [on board], we girded the ship around [the waist], and made it strong. And, because we were afraid of falling upon a precipice of the sea, we pulled down the sail; and so we drifted.
ACT|27|18||And as the storm raged violently upon us, we the next day threw goods into the sea.
ACT|27|19||And on the third day, with our own hands, we threw away the tackling of the ship.
ACT|27|20||And as the storm held on for many days, and as no sun was visible, nor moon, nor stars, all hope of our surviving was wholly cut off.
ACT|27|21||And as no one had taken a meal of food, Paul now stood up in the midst of them, and said: If ye had given heed to me, O men, we should not have sailed from Crete, and we should have been exempt from this loss and peril.
ACT|27|22||And now, I counsel you to be without anxiety; for not a soul of you will be lost, but only the ship.
ACT|27|23||For there appeared to me this night, the angel of that God whose I am, and whom I serve;
ACT|27|24||and he said to me: Fear not, Paul; for thou art yet to stand before Caesar; and, lo, God hath made a gift to thee of all them that sail with thee.
ACT|27|25||Therefore, men, be ye courageous; for I confide in God, that it will be as was told to me.
ACT|27|26||Yet we are to be cast upon a certain island.
ACT|27|27||And after the fourteen days of our roaming and tossing on the Adriatic sea, at midnight, the sailors conceived that they approached land.
ACT|27|28||And they cast the lead, and found twenty fathoms. And again they advanced a little, and they found fifteen fathoms.
ACT|27|29||And as we feared lest we should be caught in places where were rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern of the ship, and prayed for the morning.
ACT|27|30||And the sailors sought to flee out of the ship. And from it they lowered down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going in it to make fast the ship to the land.
ACT|27|31||And when Paul saw [it], he said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Unless these remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
ACT|27|32||Then the soldiers cut the boat-rope from the ship, and let the boat go adrift.
ACT|27|33||And while it was not yet morning, Paul advised them all to take food, saying to them: In consequence of the peril, it is now the fourteenth day that ye have tasted nothing.
ACT|27|34||Therefore I entreat you, to take food for the sustenance of your life; for not a hair from the head of any of you, will perish.
ACT|27|35||And having said these things, he took bread, and gave glory to God before them all; and he broke [it], and began to eat.
ACT|27|36||And they were all consoled; and they took nourishment.
ACT|27|37||And there were of us in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls.
ACT|27|38||And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, and took the wheat and cast it into the sea.
ACT|27|39||And when it was day, the sailors knew not what land it was: but they saw on the margin of the land an inlet of the sea; whither, if possible they intended to drive the ship.
ACT|27|40||And they cut away the anchors from the ship, and left them in the sea. And they loosened the bands of the rudder, and hoisted a small sail to the breeze, and made way towards the land.
ACT|27|41||And the ship struck upon a shoal between two channels of the sea, and stuck fast upon it. And the forward part rested upon it, and was immovable; but the after part was shattered by the violence of the waves.
ACT|27|42||And the soldiers were disposed to slay the prisoners; lest they should resort to swimming, and escape from them.
ACT|27|43||But the centurion kept them from it, because he was desirous to preserve Paul. And those who were able to swim, he commanded to swim off first, and pass to the land.
ACT|27|44||And the rest, he made to transport themselves on planks, and on other timbers of the ship. And so they all escaped safe to land.
ACT|28|1||And we afterwards learned, that the island was called Melita.
ACT|28|2||And the barbarians who inhabited it, showed us many kindnesses. And they kindled a fire, and called us all to warm ourselves, because of the great rain and cold at that time.
ACT|28|3||And Paul took up a bundle of fagots and laid them on the fire: and a viper, [driven] by the heat, came out of them, and bit his hand.
ACT|28|4||And when the barbarians saw it hanging on his hand, they said: Doubtless, this man is a murderer; whom, though delivered from the sea, justice will not suffer to live.
ACT|28|5||But Paul shook his hand, and threw the viper into the fire: and he received no harm.
ACT|28|6||And the barbarians expected, that he would suddenly swell, and fall dead on the ground. And when they had looked a long time, and saw that he received no harm; they changed their language, and said, that he was a god.
ACT|28|7||And there were lands in that quarter, belonging to a man named Publius, who was the chief man of the island: and he cheerfully received us at his house three days.
ACT|28|8||And the father of Publius was sick with a fever and dysentery. And Paul went in to him, and prayed, and laid his hand on him, and healed him.
ACT|28|9||And after this event, others also in the island who were sick, came to him and were healed.
ACT|28|10||And they honored us with great honors: and when we left the place, they supplied us with necessaries.
ACT|28|11||And after three months we departed, sailing in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, and which bore the signal of the Twins.
ACT|28|12||And we came to the city of Syracuse; and remained there three days.
ACT|28|13||And from there we made a circuit, and arrived at the city Rhegium. And, after one day, the south wind blew [favorably] for us, and in two days we came to Puteoli, a city of Italy.
ACT|28|14||And there we found brethren; and they invited us, and we remained with them seven days: and then we proceeded towards Rome.
ACT|28|15||And the brethren there, hearing [of our approach], came out to meet us as far as the village called Appii Forum, and as far as the Three Taverns. And when Paul saw them, he gave thanks to God, and was encouraged.
ACT|28|16||And we went on to Rome. And the centurion allowed Paul to reside where he pleased, with a soldier who guarded him.
ACT|28|17||And after three days, Paul sent and called for the principal Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, my brethren, although I had in nothing risen up against the people or the law of my fathers, I was at Jerusalem delivered over in bonds to the Romans:
ACT|28|18||and they, when they had examined me, were disposed to release me, because they found in me no offence deserving death.
ACT|28|19||And, as the Jews withstood me, I was compelled to utter an appeal to Caesar; but not because I had any thing of which to accuse the people of my nation.
ACT|28|20||For this reason I sent for you to come, that I might see you, and might state these things to you: for it is on account of the hope of Israel, that I am bound with this chain.
ACT|28|21||They said to him: We have received no epistle from Judaea against thee; and none of the brethren who have come from Jerusalem, have told us any evil thing of thee.
ACT|28|22||But we are desirous to hear from thee what thou thinkest; for this doctrine, we know, is not received by any one.
ACT|28|23||And they appointed him a day; and many assembled, and came to him at his lodgings. And he explained to them respecting the kingdom of God, testifying and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
ACT|28|24||And some of them assented to his discourses, and others did not assent.
ACT|28|25||And they went out from him, disagreeing among themselves. And Paul addressed to them this speech: Well did the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Isaiah the prophet, speak concerning your fathers,
ACT|28|26||saying: Go unto this people, and say to them, Hearing ye will hear, and will not understand; and ye will see, and will not comprehend.
ACT|28|27||For the heart of this people is stupefied, and their hearing they have made heavy, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and be converted unto me, and I should forgive them.
ACT|28|28||Therefore, be this known to you, that to the Gentiles is this redemption of God sent: and, moreover, they will hear it.
ACT|28|29||And when he had thus said, the Jews retired; and there were great disputations among them.
ACT|28|30||And Paul hired a house, at his own cost, and resided in it two years; and there he received all that came to him.
ACT|28|31||And he preached concerning the kingdom of God, and taught boldly concerning our Lord Jesus Messiah, without hinderance.
ROM|1|1||Paul, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, called and sent; and separated unto the gospel of God,
ROM|1|2||(which he had before promised, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,
ROM|1|3||concerning his Son, (who was born in the flesh, of seed of the house of David,
ROM|1|4||and was made known as the Son of God, by power, and by the Holy Spirit,) who arose from the dead, Jesus Messiah, our Lord,
ROM|1|5||by whom we have received grace, and a mission among all the Gentiles, to the end that they may obey the faith in his name;
ROM|1|6||among whom, ye also are called by Jesus Messiah;)
ROM|1|7||to all those who are at Rome, beloved of God, called and sanctified: Peace and grace be with you, from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|1|8||In the first place, I give thanks to God by Jesus Messiah, on account of you all; because your faith is heard of in all the world.
ROM|1|9||And God, whom in spirit I serve in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, that I unceasingly make mention of you, at all times, in my prayers.
ROM|1|10||And I likewise supplicate, that hereafter a door may be opened to me, by the good pleasure of God, to come unto you.
ROM|1|11||For I long much to see you; and to impart to you the gift of the Spirit, whereby ye may be established;
ROM|1|12||and that we may have comfort together, in the faith of both yourselves and me.
ROM|1|13||And I wish you to know, my brethren, that I have many times desired to come to you, (though prevented hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also; even as among other Gentiles,
ROM|1|14||Greeks and barbarians, the wise and the unwise: for to every man am I a debtor, to preach [to him].
ROM|1|15||And so I am eager to preach to you also who are at Rome.
ROM|1|16||For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto life, to all who believe in it; whether first they are of the Jews, or whether they are of the Gentiles.
ROM|1|17||For in it is revealed the righteousness of God, from faith to faith; as it is written, The righteous by faith, shall live.
ROM|1|18||For the wrath of God from heaven is revealed against all the iniquity and wickedness of men, who hold the truth in iniquity.
ROM|1|19||Because a knowledge of God is manifest in them; for God hath manifested it in them.
ROM|1|20||For, from the foundations of the world, the occult things of God are seen, by the intellect, in the things he created, even his eternal power and divinity; so that they might be without excuse;
ROM|1|21||because they knew God, and did not glorify him and give thanks to him as God, but became vain in their imaginings, and their unwise heart was darkened.
ROM|1|22||And, while they thought within themselves that they were wise, they became fools.
ROM|1|23||And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into a likeness to the image of a corruptible man, and into the likeness of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles on the earth.
ROM|1|24||For this cause, God gave them up to the filthy lusts of their heart, to dishonor their bodies with them.
ROM|1|25||And they changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the created things, much more than the Creator of them, to whom belong glory and blessing, for ever and ever: Amen.
ROM|1|26||For this cause, God gave them up to vile passions: for their females changed the use of their natures, and employed that which is unnatural.
ROM|1|27||And so also their males forsook the use of females, which is natural, and burned with lust toward one another; and, male with male, they did what is shameful, and received in themselves the just recompense of their error.
ROM|1|28||And as they did not determine with themselves to know God, God gave them over to a vain mind; that they might do what they ought not,
ROM|1|29||being full of all iniquity, and lewdness, and bitterness, and malice, and covetousness, and envy, and slaughter, and strife, and guile, and evil machinations,
ROM|1|30||and backbiting, and slander; and being haters of God, scoffers, proud, vain-glorious, devisers of evil things, destitute of reason, disregardful of parents,
ROM|1|31||and to whom a covenant is nothing, neither affection, nor peace, and in whom is no compassion.
ROM|1|32||These, while they know the judgment of God, that he condemneth those to death who perpetrate such things, are not only doers of them, but the companions of such as do them.
ROM|2|1||There is therefore no excuse for thee, O man, that judgest thy neighbor; for by judging thy neighbor, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest, dost practise the same things.
ROM|2|2||And we know that the judgment of God is in accordance with truth, in regard to those who practise these things.
ROM|2|3||And what thinkest thou, O man, that judgest those who practise these things, while practising them thyself, that thou wilt escape the judgment of God?
ROM|2|4||Or wilt thou abuse the riches of his benevolence, and his long suffering, and the opportunity which he giveth thee? And dost thou not know, that the benevolence of God should bring thee to repentance?
ROM|2|5||But, because of the hardness of thy unrepenting heart, thou art treasuring up a store of wrath against the day of wrath, and against the revelation of the righteous judgment of God:
ROM|2|6||who will recompense to every man, according to his deeds;
ROM|2|7||to them who, by perseverance in good works, seek for glory and honor and immortality, to them he will give life eternal;
ROM|2|8||but to them who are obstinate and obey not the truth, but obey iniquity, to them he will retribute wrath and ire.
ROM|2|9||And tribulation and anguish [will be] to every man that doeth evil; to the Jews first, and also to the Gentiles:
ROM|2|10||but glory and honor and peace to every one that doeth good; to the Jews first, and also to the Gentiles.
ROM|2|11||For there is no respect of persons with God:
ROM|2|12||for those without law, who sin, will also perish without law; and those under the law, who sin, will be judged by the law,
ROM|2|13||(for not the hearers of the law, are righteous before God; but the doers of the law are justified;
ROM|2|14||for if Gentiles who have not the law, shall, by their nature, do the things of the law; they, while without the law, become a law to themselves:
ROM|2|15||and they show the work of the law, as it is inscribed on their heart; and their conscience beareth testimony to them, their own reflections rebuking or vindicating one another,)
ROM|2|16||in the day in which God will judge the secret [actions] of men, as my gospel [teacheth], by Jesus the Messiah.
ROM|2|17||But if thou, who art called a Jew, and reposest thyself on the law, and gloriest in God,
ROM|2|18||that thou knowest his good pleasure, and discernest obligations, because thou art instructed in the law;
ROM|2|19||and hast confidence in thyself, that thou art a guide to the blind, and a light to them who are in darkness,
ROM|2|20||and an instructor of those lacking knowledge, and a preceptor to the young; and thou hast the appearance of knowledge and of verity in the law:
ROM|2|21||Thou therefore, who teachest others, teachest thou not thyself? And thou who teachest that men must not steal, dost thou steal?
ROM|2|22||And thou who sayest, Men must not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? And thou who contemnest idols, dost thou plunder the sanctuary?
ROM|2|23||And thou who gloriest in the law, dost thou, by acting contrary to the law, insult God himself?
ROM|2|24||For, the name of God, as it is written, is reviled among the Gentiles on your account.
ROM|2|25||For circumcision profiteth, indeed, if thou fulfillest the law: but if thou departest from the law, thy circumcision becometh uncircumcision.
ROM|2|26||And if uncircumcision should keep the precepts of the law, would not that uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?
ROM|2|27||And the uncircumcision, which from its nature fulfilleth the law, will judge thee; who, with the scripture, and with circumcision, transgressest against the law.
ROM|2|28||For he is not a Jew, who is so in what is external: nor is that circumcision, which is visible in the flesh.
ROM|2|29||But he is a Jew, who is so in what is hidden: and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not from men, but from God.
ROM|3|1||What then is the superiority of the Jew? Or what is the advantage of circumcision?
ROM|3|2||Much, every way. And first, because to them were intrusted the oracles of God.
ROM|3|3||For if some of them have not believed, have they, by their not believing, made the faith of God inefficient?
ROM|3|4||Far be it: for God is veracious, and every man false: as it is written: That thou mightest be upright, in thy declarations; and be found pure, when they judge thee.
ROM|3|5||But if our iniquity establish the rectitude of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous, when he inflicteth wrath? (I speak as a man.)
ROM|3|6||Far from it. Otherwise how will God judge the world?
ROM|3|7||But if the truth of God hath been furthered by my falsehood, to his glory; why am I then condemned as a sinner?
ROM|3|8||Or shall we say as some have slanderously reported us to say: We will do evil things, that good [results] may come? The condemnation of such is reserved for justice.
ROM|3|9||What then, have WE the superiority, when we have before decided as to both Jews and Gentiles, that all of them are under sin?
ROM|3|10||As it is written: There is none righteous; no, no one:
ROM|3|11||and none that understandeth; nor that seeketh after God.
ROM|3|12||They have all turned aside, together; and become reprobates. There is none that doeth good; no, not one.
ROM|3|13||Their throats are open sepulchres, and their tongues treacherous; and the venom of the asp is under their lips.
ROM|3|14||Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
ROM|3|15||and their feet are swift to shed blood.
ROM|3|16||Destruction and anguish are in their paths:
ROM|3|17||and the path of peacefulness they have not known:
ROM|3|18||and the fear of God is not before their eyes.
ROM|3|19||Now we know, that whatever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be guilty before God.
ROM|3|20||Wherefore, by the deeds of the law, no flesh is justified before him: for, by the law, sin is known.
ROM|3|21||But now, the righteousness of God without the law, is manifested; and the law and the prophets testify of it:
ROM|3|22||even the righteousness of God, which is by faith in Jesus Messiah, for every one, and on every one, that believeth in him: for there is no distinction;
ROM|3|23||for they have all sinned, and failed of the glory of God.
ROM|3|24||And they are justified gratuitously, by grace, and by the redemption which is in Jesus Messiah;
ROM|3|25||whom God hath preconstituted a propitiation, by faith in his blood, because of our sins, which we before committed,
ROM|3|26||in the space which God in his long suffering gave to us, for the manifestation of his righteousness at the present time; that he might be righteous, and might with righteousness justify him who is in the faith of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|3|27||Where then is glorying? It is annihilated. By what law? by that of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
ROM|3|28||We therefore conclude, that it is by faith a man is justified, and not by the works of the law.
ROM|3|29||For, is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles? Nay: of the Gentiles also.
ROM|3|30||Because there is, one God, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision by the same faith.
ROM|3|31||Do, we then nullify the law by faith? Far be it. On the contrary, we establish the law.
ROM|4|1||What then shall we say concerning Abraham the patriarch, that by the flesh he obtained?
ROM|4|2||But if Abraham was justified by works, he had [ground of] glorying; yet not before God.
ROM|4|3||For what saith the scripture? That Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
ROM|4|4||But to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as a debt to him.
ROM|4|5||Whereas, to him that worketh not, but only believeth in him that justifieth sinners, his faith is accounted to him for righteousness.
ROM|4|6||As David also speaketh of the blessedness of the man, to whom God reckoneth righteousness without works,
ROM|4|7||saying: Blessed are they, whose iniquity is forgiven, and whose sins are covered up:
ROM|4|8||and, Blessed is the man, to whom God will not reckon his sin.
ROM|4|9||This blessedness, therefore, is it on the circumcision? or on the uncircumcision? For we say, that Abraham's faith was reckoned to him for righteousness.
ROM|4|10||How then was it reckoned to him? In circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
ROM|4|11||For he received circumcision, as the sign and the seal of the righteousness of his faith while in uncircumcision: that he might become the father of all them of the uncircumcision who believe; and that it might be reckoned to them also for righteousness:
ROM|4|12||and the father of the circumcision; not to them only who are of the circumcision, but to them also who fulfill the steps of the faith of our father Abraham in [his] uncircumcision.
ROM|4|13||For the promise to Abraham and to his seed, that he should become the heir of the world, was not by the law, but by the righteousness of his faith.
ROM|4|14||For if they who are of the law were heirs, faith would be made void, and the promise of no force.
ROM|4|15||For the law is a worker of wrath; because where no law is, there is no transgression of law.
ROM|4|16||Wherefore, it is by the faith which is by grace, that we are justified: so that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:
ROM|4|17||as it is written: "I have constituted thee a father to a multitude of nations;" [namely] before God, in whom thou hast believed; who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which are not, as if they were.
ROM|4|18||And without hope, he confided in the hope of becoming the father of a multitude of nations; (as it is written: So will thy seed be.)
ROM|4|19||And he was not sickly in his faith, while contemplating his inert body, (for he was a hundred years old,) and the inert womb of Sarah.
ROM|4|20||And he did not hesitate at the promise of God, as one lacking faith; but he was strong in faith, and gave glory to God;
ROM|4|21||and felt assured, that what God had promised to him, he was able to fulfill.
ROM|4|22||And therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness.
ROM|4|23||And not for his sake alone, was it written, that his faith was accounted for righteousness;
ROM|4|24||but for our sakes also; because it is to be accounted [so] to us, who believe in him that raised our Lord Jesus Messiah from the dead;
ROM|4|25||who was delivered up, on account of our sins; and arose, that he might justify us.
ROM|5|1||Therefore, because we are justified by faith, we shall have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|5|2||By whom we are brought by faith into this grace, in which we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
ROM|5|3||And not only so, but we also rejoice in afflictions; because we know that affliction perfecteth in us patience;
ROM|5|4||and patience, experience; and experience, hope:
ROM|5|5||and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is diffused in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.
ROM|5|6||And if at this time, on account of our weakness, Messiah died for the ungodly:
ROM|5|7||(for rarely doth one die for the ungodly; though for the good, some one perhaps might venture to die:)
ROM|5|8||God hath here manifested his love towards us. Because, if when we were sinners, Messiah died for us;
ROM|5|9||how much more, shall we now be justified by his blood and be rescued from wrath by him?
ROM|5|10||For if when we were enemies, God was reconciled with us by the death of his Son; how much more shall we, in his reconciliation, live by his life?
ROM|5|11||And not only so, but we also rejoice in God, by means of our Lord Jesus Messiah, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
ROM|5|12||As by means of one man, sin entered into the world, and, by means of sin, death; and so death passed upon all the sons of men, inasmuch as they all have sinned:
ROM|5|13||For until the law, sin, although it was in the world, was not accounted sin, because there was no law.
ROM|5|14||Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression of the command by Adam, who was the type of him that was to come.
ROM|5|15||But not, as the fault, so also the free gift. For if, on account of the fault of one, many died; how much more, will the grace of God and his free gift, on account of one man, Jesus Messiah, abound unto many?
ROM|5|16||And not, as the offence of one, so also the free gift. For the judgment, which was of one [offence], was unto condemnation; but the free gift was, of many sins, unto righteousness.
ROM|5|17||For if, on account of the offence of one, death reigned; still more, they who receive the abundance of the grace, and the free gift, and the righteousness, will reign in life, by means of one, Jesus Messiah.
ROM|5|18||Therefore, as on account of the offence of one, condemnation was to all men; so on account of the righteousness of one, will the victory unto life be to all men.
ROM|5|19||For as, on account of the disobedience of one man, many became sinners; so also, on account of the obedience of one, many become righteous.
ROM|5|20||And the entrance given to the law, was that sin might increase: and where sin increased, there grace abounded.
ROM|5|21||So that, as sin had reigned in death, so grace might reign in righteousness unto life eternal, by means of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|6|1||What shall we then say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
ROM|6|2||Far be it: for if we are persons that have died to sin, how can we again live in it?
ROM|6|3||Or do ye not know, that we who are baptized into Jesus Messiah, are baptized into his death?
ROM|6|4||For we are buried with him in baptism unto death; that as Jesus Messiah arose from the dead into the glory of his Father, so also we, to walk in a new life.
ROM|6|5||For if we have been planted together with him into the likeness of his death, so shall we be also into his resurrection.
ROM|6|6||For we know, that our old man is crucified with him; that the body of sin might be abolished, and we be no more servants to sin:
ROM|6|7||for he that is dead [to it], is emancipated from sin.
ROM|6|8||If then we are dead with Messiah, let us believe that we shall live with the same Messiah.
ROM|6|9||For we know that Messiah rose from the dead, and no more dieth; death hath no dominion over him.
ROM|6|10||For in dying, he died for sin, once; and in living, he liveth unto God.
ROM|6|11||So also do ye account yourselves as being dead to sin, and alive to God, through our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|6|12||Therefore let not sin reign in your dead body, so that ye obey its lusts.
ROM|6|13||And also give not up your members as instruments of evil unto sin, but give up yourselves to God, as those who have been resuscitated from the dead; and let your members be instruments for the righteousness of God.
ROM|6|14||And sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
ROM|6|15||What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? Far be it.
ROM|6|16||Know ye not, that to whomsoever ye give up yourselves to serve in bondage, his servants ye are, whom ye serve; whether it be to sin, or whether it be to righteousness, that ye give ear?
ROM|6|17||But thanks be to God, that ye were [once] the servants of sin but have [now] from the heart obeyed that form of doctrine to which ye are devoted.
ROM|6|18||And when ye were emancipated from sin, ye became servants to righteousness.
ROM|6|19||(I speak as among men, because of the infirmity of your flesh.)As ye [once] gave up your members to the servitude of pollution and iniquity, so also now give ye up your members to the servitude of righteousness and sanctity.
ROM|6|20||For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were emancipated from righteousness.
ROM|6|21||And what harvest had ye then, in that of which ye are now ashamed? For the result thereof is death.
ROM|6|22||And now, as ye have been emancipated from sin, and have become servants to God, your fruits are holy; and the result thereof is life everlasting.
ROM|6|23||For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is life eternal, through our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|7|1||Or do ye not know, my Brethren.(for I am speaking to them that know the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as he is alive?
ROM|7|2||Just as a woman, by the law, is bound to her husband, as long as he is alive: but if her husband should die, she is freed from the law of her husband.
ROM|7|3||And if, while her husband is alive, she should adhere to another man, she would become an adulteress: but if her husband should die, she is freed from the law; and would not be an adulteress though joined to another man.
ROM|7|4||And now, my brethren, ye also have become dead to the law, by the body of Messiah; that ye might be joined to another, [even] to him who arose from the dead; and might yield fruits unto God.
ROM|7|5||For while we were in the flesh, the emotions of sin which are by the law, were active in our members, that we should bear fruits unto death.
ROM|7|6||But now we are absolved from the law, and are dead to that which held us in its grasp: that we might henceforth serve in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
ROM|7|7||What shall we say then? Is the law sin?, Far be it. For I had not learned sin, except by means of the law: for I had not known concupiscence, had not the law said, Thou shalt not covet:
ROM|7|8||and by this commandment, sin found occasion, and perfected in me all concupiscence: for without the law, sin was dead.
ROM|7|9||And I, without the law, was alive formerly; but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died;
ROM|7|10||and the commandment of life was found by me [to be] unto death.
ROM|7|11||For sin, by the occasion which it found by means of the commandment, seduced me; and thereby slew me.
ROM|7|12||Wherefore, the law is holy; and the commandment is holy, and righteous, and good.
ROM|7|13||Did that which is good, therefore, become death to me? Far be it. But sin, that it might be seen to be sin, perfected death in me by means of that good [law]; that sin might the more be condemned, by means of the commandment.
ROM|7|14||For we know, that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, and sold to sin.
ROM|7|15||For what I am doing, I know not: and what I would, I do not perform; but what I hate, that I do.
ROM|7|16||And if I do what I would not, I testify of the law, that it is right.
ROM|7|17||And then, it is no more I who do that thing; but sin, which dwelleth in me.
ROM|7|18||For I know, that in me, (that is, in my flesh,) good dwelleth not: because, to approve the good, is easy for me; but to do it, I am unable.
ROM|7|19||For I do not perform the good, which I would perform; but the bad, which I would not perform, that I do perform.
ROM|7|20||And if I do what I would not, it is not I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
ROM|7|21||I find therefore a law coinciding with my conscience, which assenteth to my doing good, whereas evil is near to me.
ROM|7|22||For I rejoice in the law of God, in the interior man.
ROM|7|23||But I see another law in my members, which warreth against the law of my conscience, and maketh me a captive to the law of sin which existeth in my members
ROM|7|24||O, a miserable man, am I! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
ROM|7|25||I thank God; by means of our Lord Jesus Messiah [I shall be rescued.] Now, therefore, in my conscience, I am a servant of the law of God; but in my flesh, I am a servant of the law of sin.
ROM|8|1||There is therefore no condemnation, to them who, in Jesus Messiah, walk not after the flesh.
ROM|8|2||For the law of the spirit of life, which is in Jesus Messiah, hath emancipated thee from the law of sin and death.
ROM|8|3||Inasmuch as the law was impotent, by means of the weakness of the flesh, God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin; that He might, in his flesh, condemn sin;
ROM|8|4||so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us; since it is not in the flesh that we walk, but in the Spirit.
ROM|8|5||For they who are in the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: and they who are of the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit.
ROM|8|6||For minding the things of the flesh, is death; but minding the things of the Spirit, is life and peace.
ROM|8|7||Because minding the things of the flesh, is enmity towards God: for it doth not subject itself to the law of God, because it is not possible.
ROM|8|8||And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM|8|9||Ye, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; if the Spirit of God truly dwelleth in you. And if in any one there is not the Spirit of Messiah he is none of his.
ROM|8|10||But if Messiah is in you, the body is dead, in regard to sin; and the Spirit is alive in regard to righteousness.
ROM|8|11||And if the Spirit of him, who raised our Lord Jesus Messiah from the dead, dwelleth in you; he who raised our Lord Jesus Messiah from the dead, will also vivify your dead bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
ROM|8|12||Now we are debtors, my Brethren, not to the flesh, that we should walk according to the flesh:
ROM|8|13||(For if ye live according to the flesh, ye are to die. But if, by the Spirit, ye mortify the practices of the body, ye will live.
ROM|8|14||For they who are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God:)
ROM|8|15||For ye have not received the spirit of bondage, again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Father, our Father.
ROM|8|16||And this Spirit testifieth to our spirit, that we are the sons of God.
ROM|8|17||And if sons, then heirs; heirs of God, and participators of the inheritance of Jesus Messiah: so that, if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him.
ROM|8|18||For I reckon, that the sufferings of the present time, are not comparable with the glory which is to be developed in us.
ROM|8|19||For the whole creation is hoping and waiting for the development of the sons of God.
ROM|8|20||For the creation was subjected to vanity, not by its own choice, but because of him who subjected it,
ROM|8|21||in the hope, that also the creation itself would be emancipated from the bondage of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.
ROM|8|22||For we know, that all the creatures are groaning and travailing in pain unto this day.
ROM|8|23||And not only they, but we also in whom are the first fruits of the Spirit, we groan within ourselves, and look anxiously for the adoption of sons, the redemption of our bodies.
ROM|8|24||Because we live in hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope: for if we saw it, how should we hope for it?
ROM|8|25||But if we hope for that which is not seen, we are in patient waiting.
ROM|8|26||So also the Spirit aideth our weakness. For we know not what to pray for, in a proper manner; but the Spirit prayeth for us, with groans not expressible:
ROM|8|27||and the explorer of hearts, he knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit; because he prayeth for the saints, agreeably to the good pleasure of God.
ROM|8|28||And we know that he aideth him in all things, for good, who love God; them whom he predestined to be called.
ROM|8|29||And he knew them, previously; and he sealed them with the likeness of the image of his Son; that He might be the first-born of many brothers.
ROM|8|30||And those whom he previously sealed, them he called: and those whom he called, them he justified: and those whom he justified, them he glorified.
ROM|8|31||What then shall we say of these things? If God [is] for us; who [is] against us?
ROM|8|32||And, if he spared not his Son, but gave him up for us all, how shall he not give us all things, with him?
ROM|8|33||Who will set himself against the chosen of God? It is God who justifieth.
ROM|8|34||Who is it that condemneth? Messiah died, and arose, and is on the right hand of God, and maketh intercession for us.
ROM|8|35||What will sever me from the love of Messiah? Will affliction? or distress? or persecution? or famine? or nakedness? or peril? or the sword?
ROM|8|36||As it is written: For thy sake, we die daily: and, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
ROM|8|37||But in all these things we are victorious, by means of him who loved us.
ROM|8|38||For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
ROM|8|39||nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to sever me from the love of God, which is in our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|9|1||I say the truth in Messiah, and do not misrepresent; and my conscience beareth me witness in the Holy Spirit;
ROM|9|2||that I have great sorrow, and the sadness of my heart is unceasing.
ROM|9|3||For I have prayed, that I myself might be accursed from Messiah, for my brethren and my kinsmen in the flesh:
ROM|9|4||who are sons of Israel, to whom belonged the adoption of sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law, and the ministration, and the promises, and the fathers;
ROM|9|5||and from among whom, Messiah appeared in the flesh, who is God over all; to whom be praises and benediction, for ever and ever; Amen.
ROM|9|6||Not, however, that the word of God hath actually failed. For all are not Israel, who are of Israel.
ROM|9|7||Neither are they all sons, because they are of the seed of Abraham: for it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
ROM|9|8||That is, it is not the children of the flesh, who are the children of God; but the children of the promise, are accounted for the seed.
ROM|9|9||For the word of promise was this: At that time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
ROM|9|10||Nor this only; but Rebecca also, when she had cohabited with one [man], our father Isaac,
ROM|9|11||before her children were born, or: had done good or evil, the choice of God was predeclared; that it might stand, not of works, but of him who called.
ROM|9|12||For it was said: The elder shall be servant to the younger.
ROM|9|13||As it is written: Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.
ROM|9|14||What shall we say then? Is there iniquity with God? Far be it.
ROM|9|15||Behold, to Moses also he said: I will have pity, on whom I will have pity; and I will be merciful, to whom I will be merciful.
ROM|9|16||Therefore, it is not of him who is willing, nor of him who runneth, but of the merciful God.
ROM|9|17||For in the scripture, he said to Pharaoh: For this very thing, have I raised thee up; that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
ROM|9|18||Wherefore, he hath pity upon whom he pleaseth; and whom he pleaseth, he hardeneth.
ROM|9|19||But, perhaps thou wilt say: Of what [then] doth he complain? For, who hath resisted his pleasure?
ROM|9|20||Thou, thus! Who art thou? O man; that thou repliest against God! Shall the potter's vessel say to the former of it, Why hast thou formed me so?
ROM|9|21||Hath not the potter dominion over his clay out of the same mass to make vessels, one for honor, and another for dishonor?
ROM|9|22||And if God, being disposed to exhibit his wrath and to make known his power, in abundance of long-suffering, brought wrath upon the vessels of wrath which were complete for destruction;
ROM|9|23||and made his mercy flow forth upon the vessels of mercy, which were prepared by God for glory;
ROM|9|24||namely, upon us who are called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles:
ROM|9|25||As also he said in Hosea: I will call them my people, who were not my people; and will pity, whom I have not pitied:
ROM|9|26||For it shall be, that in the place where they were called: Not my people, there shall they be called: The children of the living God.
ROM|9|27||And Isaiah proclaimed concerning the children of Israel: Though the number of the children of Israel should be as the sand on the sea, a remnant of them will live.
ROM|9|28||He hath finished and cut short the matter: and the Lord will do it on the earth.
ROM|9|29||And according to what Isaiah had before said: If the Lord of hosts had not favored us with a residue, we had been as Sodom, and had been like Gomorrha.
ROM|9|30||What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who ran not after righteousness, have found righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith:
ROM|9|31||But Israel, who ran after the law of righteousness, hath not found the law of righteousness.
ROM|9|32||And why? Because [they sought it], not by faith, but by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone:
ROM|9|33||As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone, and a stone of offence: and he who believeth in him, shall not be ashamed.
ROM|10|1||My Brethren, The desire of my heart, and my intercession with God for them, is, that they might have life.
ROM|10|2||For I bear them witness, that there is in them a zeal for God; but it is not according to knowledge.
ROM|10|3||For they know not the righteousness of God, but seek to establish their own righteousness: and therefore they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.
ROM|10|4||For Messiah is the aim of the law, for righteousness, unto every one that believeth in him.
ROM|10|5||For Moses describeth the righteousness, which is by the law, thus: Whoever shall do these things, shall live by them.
ROM|10|6||But the righteousness which is by faith, saith thus: Thou shalt not say in thy heart, Who ascendeth to heaven, and bringeth Messiah down?
ROM|10|7||Or, Who descendeth to the abyss of the grave, and bringeth up Messiah from the place of the dead?
ROM|10|8||But what saith it? The thing is near to thy mouth, and to thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim.
ROM|10|9||And if thou shalt confess with thy mouth our Lord Jesus, and shalt believe with thy heart, that God hath raised him from the dead; thou shalt live.
ROM|10|10||For the heart that believeth in him, is justified; and the mouth that confesseth him, is restored to life.
ROM|10|11||For the scripture saith: Every one that believeth in him, shall not be ashamed.
ROM|10|12||And in this, it discriminateth neither Jews nor Gentiles. For there is one Lord over them all, who is rich, towards every one that calleth on him.
ROM|10|13||For every one that shall call on the name of the Lord, will have life.
ROM|10|14||How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or, how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? Or, how shall they hear, without a preacher?
ROM|10|15||Or, how shall they preach, if they are not sent forth? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of the heralds of peace, and of the heralds of good things?
ROM|10|16||But all of them have not obeyed the proclamation of the gospel. (For, Isaiah said: My Lord, who hath believed our proclamation?)
ROM|10|17||Therefore, faith is from the hearing of the ear; and the hearing of the ear, is from the word of God.
ROM|10|18||But I say: Have they not heard? And, lo, their proclamation hath gone out into all the earth; and their words to the ends of the world.
ROM|10|19||But I say: Did not Israel know? First, Moses said, thus: I will awaken your emulation, by a people which is not a people; and by a disobedient people, I will provoke you.
ROM|10|20||And Isaiah was bold, and said: I was seen by those who sought me not; and I was found by those who inquired not for me.
ROM|10|21||But to Israel, he said: All the day, have I stretched out my hands to a contentious and disobedient people.
ROM|11|1||But I say: Hath God cast off his people? Far be it. For I also am of Israel, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
ROM|11|2||God hath not cast off those his people whom he before knew. Do ye not know, what, in the scripture of God, he said to Elijah? When he had complained to God against Israel, and said:
ROM|11|3||My Lord, they have slain thy prophets, and have thrown down thy altars; and I am left alone; and they seek my life.
ROM|11|4||And it was said to him, by revelation: Behold, I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed their knees, and have not worshipped Baal.
ROM|11|5||So also at the present time, a remnant is preserved, by the election of grace.
ROM|11|6||But if by grace, it is not by works: otherwise, grace is not grace. And if by works, it is not by grace: Otherwise, work is not work.
ROM|11|7||What then? Israel did not obtain that which it sought: but the election obtained it; and the rest of them were blinded in their heart,
ROM|11|8||(as it is written: God gave them a stupid spirit, and eyes to see not, and ears to hear not), unto this very day.
ROM|11|9||And again, David said: Let their table become a snare before them; and let their recompense be a stumbling block.
ROM|11|10||Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and let their back, at all times, be bowed down.
ROM|11|11||But I say: Have they so stumbled as to fall entirely? Far be it. Rather, by their stumbling, life hath come to the Gentiles, for [awakening] their jealousy.
ROM|11|12||And if their stumbling was riches to the world, and their condemnation riches to the Gentiles; how much more their completeness?
ROM|11|13||But [it is] to you Gentiles, I am speaking: as I am a legate to the Gentiles, I honor my ministry;
ROM|11|14||if, perhaps, I may provoke emulation in the children of my flesh, and may vivify some of them.
ROM|11|15||For if the rejection of them, was a reconciliation of the world; what will their conversion be, but life from the dead?
ROM|11|16||For, if the first-fruits [are] holy, then the mass [is] also: and if the root is holy, then also the branches.
ROM|11|17||And if some of the branches were plucked off; and thou, an olive from the desert, wast in-grafted in their place, and hast become a participator of the root and fatness of the olive-tree;
ROM|11|18||do not glory over the branches. For if thou gloriest, thou sustainest not the root, but the root sustaineth thee.
ROM|11|19||And shouldst thou say, The branches were plucked off, that I might be grafted into their place.
ROM|11|20||Very true. They were plucked off, because they believed not; and thou standest by faith. Be not exalted in thy mind, but fear.
ROM|11|21||For if God spared not the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.
ROM|11|22||Behold now the benignity and the severity of God: on them who fell, severity; but on thee, benignity, if thou continuest in that benignity; and if not, thou also wilt be plucked off.
ROM|11|23||And they, if they do not continue in their destitution of faith, even they will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
ROM|11|24||For if thou wast plucked from the wild olive-tree, which was natural to thee, and wast grafted, contrary to thy nature, into a good olive-tree; how much more may they be grafted into their natural olive-tree?
ROM|11|25||And that ye, my brethren, may not be wise in your own apprehension, I wish you to know this mystery, that blindness of heart hath in some measure befallen Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in:
ROM|11|26||and then, will all Israel live. As it is written: A deliverer will come from Zion, and will turn away iniquity from Jacob.
ROM|11|27||And then will they have the covenant that proceedeth from me, when I shall have forgiven their sins.
ROM|11|28||Now, in the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but in the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.
ROM|11|29||For God is not changeable in his free gift and in his calling.
ROM|11|30||For as ye too were formerly disobedient to God, and have now obtained mercy, because of their disobedience;
ROM|11|31||so also are they now disobedient to the mercy, which is upon you, that there may be mercy on them likewise.
ROM|11|32||For God hath shut up all men in disobedience, that upon all men he might have mercy.
ROM|11|33||O the depth of the riches, and the wisdom, and the knowledge of God! For man hath not searched out his judgments; and his ways are inscrutable.
ROM|11|34||For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been a counsellor to him?
ROM|11|35||Or who hath first given to him, and then received from him?
ROM|11|36||Because, all is from him, and all by him, and all through him: to whom be praises and benedictions, for ever and ever: Amen.
ROM|12|1||I beseech you, therefore, my brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, by a rational service [of him].
ROM|12|2||And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed, by the renovation of your minds: and discern ye what is the good and acceptable and perfect pleasure of God.
ROM|12|3||And, by the grace given to me, I say to you all: Do not carry thoughts, beyond what ye ought to think; but think with modesty, as God hath distributed to each one his measure of faith.
ROM|12|4||For as we [severally] have many members in one body, and all those members have not the same functions;
ROM|12|5||so also we, who are [collectively] many persons, are one body in Messiah, and are naturally members of each other.
ROM|12|6||But we have different gifts, according to the grace given to us. There is that of prophecy, according to the measure of his faith.
ROM|12|7||And there is that of ministration, possessed by one in his ministry. And there is that of a teacher, in his teaching.
ROM|12|8||And there is that of a consoler, in his consoling: And that of a giver, with simplicity: And that of a presider, with dexterity: And of a sympathizer, with cheerfulness.
ROM|12|9||Let not your love be guileful: but be haters of evil things, and adherers to good things.
ROM|12|10||Be affectionate to your brethren: and love one another. Be foremost in honoring one another.
ROM|12|11||Be active; and not slothful. Be fervent in spirit. Be laborers for our Lord.
ROM|12|12||Be joyful in your hope. Be patient under your afflictions. Be persevering in prayer.
ROM|12|13||Be communicators to the wants of the saints. Be kind to strangers.
ROM|12|14||Bless your persecutors: bless, and curse not.
ROM|12|15||Rejoice with them who rejoice: and weep with them who weep.
ROM|12|16||What estimation ye make of yourselves, [make] also of your brethren. And indulge not high thoughts; but unite yourselves with the lowly minded. And be not wise in your own estimation.
ROM|12|17||And repay to no man evil for evil: but let it be your study to do good before all men.
ROM|12|18||And if possible, so far as it dependeth on you, live in peace with every man.
ROM|12|19||And be ye not avengers of yourselves, my beloved: but give place to wrath. For it is written: If thou dost not execute judgment for thyself, I will execute judgment for thee, saith God.
ROM|12|20||And if thy adversary be hungry, feed him: and if he be thirsty, give him drink. For if thou doest these things to him, thou wilt heap coals of fire on his head.
ROM|12|21||Be ye not overcome by evil; but overcome evil with good.
ROM|13|1||Let every soul be subject to the authorities of magistracy. For there is no authority which is not from God: and the authorities which exist, are established by God.
ROM|13|2||He therefore who opposeth the authority, opposeth the establishment of God; and they who oppose them, shall receive judgment.
ROM|13|3||For judges are not a terror to good deeds, but to evil deeds. Wouldst thou then not be afraid of the authority? Do good, and thou shalt have praise from it.
ROM|13|4||For he is the minister of God; but it is to thee for good. But if thou doest evil, be afraid; for he is not girded with the sword in vain; for he is a minister of God, and an avenger of wrath to them that do evil things.
ROM|13|5||And therefore, it is necessary for us to be obedient, not only on account of wrath, but likewise on account of our consciences.
ROM|13|6||For this cause also ye pay tribute money; for they are the ministers of God, established for these same objects.
ROM|13|7||Render therefore to every one, as is due to him; tribute-money, to whom tribute-money; and excise, to whom excise; and fear, to whom fear; and honor, to whom honor.
ROM|13|8||And owe nothing to any one; but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbor, hath fulfilled the law.
ROM|13|9||For this likewise, which it saith: Thou shalt not kill; nor commit adultery; nor steal; nor covet; and if there is any other commandment, it is completed in this sentence: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
ROM|13|10||Love doeth no evil to one's neighbor; because love is the fulfillment of the law.
ROM|13|11||And this also know ye, that it is the time and the hour, that we should henceforth be awake from our sleep. For now our life hath come nearer to us, than when we believed.
ROM|13|12||The night now passeth away, and the day draweth near. Let us therefore cast from us the works of darkness; and let us put on the armor of light.
ROM|13|13||And let us walk decorously, as in daylight; not in merriment, nor in drunkenness, nor in impurity of the bed, nor in envy and strife.
ROM|13|14||But clothe yourselves with our Lord Jesus Messiah: and be not thoughtful about your flesh, for the indulgence of appetites.
ROM|14|1||To him who is feeble in the faith, reach forth the hand. And be not divided in your thoughts.
ROM|14|2||For one man believeth, that he may eat every thing: and he that is feeble, eateth herbs.
ROM|14|3||And he that eateth, should not despise him that eateth not; and he that eateth not, should not judge him that eateth, for God hath received him.
ROM|14|4||Who art thou, that thou judgest a servant not thine; and who, if he standeth, he standeth to his Lord; and if he falleth, he falleth to his Lord? But he will assuredly stand; for his Lord hath power to establish him.
ROM|14|5||One man discriminateth between days; and another judgeth all days alike. But let every one be sure, in regard to his knowledge.
ROM|14|6||He that esteemeth a day, esteemeth [it] for his Lord: and he that esteemeth not a day, for his Lord, he doth not esteem [it.] And he that eateth, eateth to his Lord, and giveth thanks to God: and he that eateth not, to his Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.
ROM|14|7||For there is not one of us, who liveth for himself: and there is not one, who dieth for himself.
ROM|14|8||Because, if we live, to our Lord it is we live; or if we die, to our Lord it is we die. Whether we live, therefore, or whether we die, we are our Lord's.
ROM|14|9||Moreover, for this cause Messiah died, and revived, and arose; that he might be Lord of the dead and of the living.
ROM|14|10||But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we must all stand before the judgment seat of Messiah,
ROM|14|11||as it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow; and to me every tongue shall give praise.
ROM|14|12||So then, every one of us must give account of himself to God.
ROM|14|13||Henceforth, judge ye not one another; but rather, judge ye this, that thou erect not a stumbling-block for thy brother.
ROM|14|14||I know indeed, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing which is unclean in itself; but to him who thinketh any thing to be unclean, to him only it is defiled.
ROM|14|15||But if thou grievest thy brother, because of food, thou walkest not in love. On account of food, destroy not him for whom Messiah died.
ROM|14|16||And let not our good thing be matter of reproach.
ROM|14|17||For the kingdom of God, is not food and drink; but is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
ROM|14|18||For he who is in these things a servant of Messiah, is pleasing to God, and approved before men.
ROM|14|19||Now let us strive after peace, and after the edification of one another.
ROM|14|20||And let us not, on account of food, destroy the work of God. For every thing is, [indeed,] pure; yet it is evil, to the man who eateth with stumbling.
ROM|14|21||It is proper, that we neither eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor [do] any thing, whereby our brother is stumbled.
ROM|14|22||Thou art one in whom there is faith; keep it to thyself, before God. Blessed is he, who doth not condemn himself, in that thing which he alloweth.
ROM|14|23||For he who eateth and doubteth, is condemned; because [he eateth] not in faith. For every thing which is not of faith, is sin.
ROM|15|1||We then who are strong, ought to bear the infirmity of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
ROM|15|2||But each of us should please his neighbor, in good things, as conducive to edification.
ROM|15|3||Because Messiah also did not please himself; but, as it is written: The reviling of thy revilers fell upon me.
ROM|15|4||For every thing written of old, was written for our instruction; that we, by patience and by the consolation of the scriptures, might possess hope.
ROM|15|5||And may the God of patience and of consolation, grant to you, to think in harmony one with another, in Jesus Messiah;
ROM|15|6||so that with one mind and one mouth, ye may glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
ROM|15|7||Wherefore, receive ye and bear up one another, as also Messiah received you, to the glory of God.
ROM|15|8||Now I say, that Jesus Messiah ministered to the circumcision, in behalf of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promise [made] to the fathers;
ROM|15|9||and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercies upon them, as it is written: I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and to thy name will I sing psalms.
ROM|15|10||And again he said: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
ROM|15|11||And again he said: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; [and] laud him, all ye nations.
ROM|15|12||And again Isaiah said: There will be a root of Jesse; and he that shall arise, will be a prince for the Gentiles; and in him will the Gentiles hope.
ROM|15|13||Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace, by faith; that ye may abound in his hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM|15|14||Now I am persuaded, my Brethren, even I, concerning you; that ye too are full of goodness, and are replenished with all knowledge, and are able also to instruct others.
ROM|15|15||Yet I have written rather boldly to you, my Brethren, that I might put you in remembrance; because of the grace which is given to me by God,
ROM|15|16||that I should be a minister of Jesus Messiah among the Gentiles, and should subserve the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles might be acceptable, and be sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
ROM|15|17||I have therefore a glorying in Jesus Messiah, before God.
ROM|15|18||Yet I presume not to speak of any thing [done] for the obedience of the Gentiles, which Messiah hath not wrought by me, in word and in deeds,
ROM|15|19||by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem I have made a circuit quite to Illyricum, and have fulfilled the announcement of the Messiah;
ROM|15|20||while I was careful not to preach where the name of Messiah had been invoked, lest I should build upon another man's foundation;
ROM|15|21||but, it is written: They, to whom mention of him had not been made, will see him; and they, who had not heard, will be obedient.
ROM|15|22||And on this account, I have been many times prevented from coming to you.
ROM|15|23||But now, since I have no place in these regions, and as I have been desirous for many years past to come to you,
ROM|15|24||when I go to Spain, I hope to come and see you; and that ye will accompany me thither, when I shall have been satisfied, in some measure, with visiting you.
ROM|15|25||But I am now going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.
ROM|15|26||For they of Macedonia and Achaia, have been willing to make up a contribution for the needy saints who are at Jerusalem.
ROM|15|27||They were willing, because they were also debtors to them: for if the Gentiles have been participators with them in the Spirit, they are debtors to serve them also in things of the flesh.
ROM|15|28||When therefore, I shall have accomplished this, and shall have sealed to them this fruit, I will pass by you into Spain.
ROM|15|29||And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Messiah.
ROM|15|30||And I beseech you, my Brethren, by our Lord Jesus Messiah, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye labor with me in prayer to God for me;
ROM|15|31||that I may be delivered from them in Judaea, who believe not and that the ministration, which I carry to the saints in Jerusalem, may be well received;
ROM|15|32||and that, by the good pleasure of God, I may come to you with joy, and may take comfort with you.
ROM|15|33||And may the God of peace be with you all: Amen.
ROM|16|1||And I commend to you Phebe, our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea:
ROM|16|2||that ye may receive her in our Lord, as is just for saints; and that ye may assist her, in whatever thing she may ask of you: for she also hath been assistant to many, and to me also.
ROM|16|3||Salute ye Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-laborers in Jesus Messiah;
ROM|16|4||who, for my life, surrendered their own necks; and to whom, not only I am grateful, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
ROM|16|5||And give a salutation to the church which is in their house. Salute my beloved Epenetus, who was the first-fruits of Achaia in Messiah.
ROM|16|6||Salute Mary, who hath toiled much with you.
ROM|16|7||Salute Andronicus and Junia, my relatives, who were in captivity with me, and are of note among the legates, and were in Messiah before me.
ROM|16|8||Salute Amplias, my beloved in our Lord.
ROM|16|9||Salute Urbanus, a laborer with us in Messiah; and my beloved Stachys.
ROM|16|10||Salute Apelles, chosen in our Lord. Salute the members of the house of Aristobulus.
ROM|16|11||Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute the members of the house of Narcissus, who are in our Lord.
ROM|16|12||Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who toil in our Lord. Salute my beloved Persis, who toiled much in our Lord.
ROM|16|13||Salute Rufus, chosen in our Lord; and his and my mother.
ROM|16|14||Salute Asyncritus, and Phlegon, and Hermas, and Patrobas, and Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.
ROM|16|15||Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
ROM|16|16||Salute one another, with a holy kiss. All the churches of Messiah salute you.
ROM|16|17||And I beseech you, my Brethren, that ye beware of them who cause divisions and stumblings [among you], aside from the doctrine which ye have learned: and that ye stand aloof from them.
ROM|16|18||For they who are such, do not serve our Lord Jesus Messiah, but their own belly: and by bland speeches and good wishes, they beguile the hearts of the simple.
ROM|16|19||But your obedience is known to every one. I therefore rejoice in you: and I would have you be wise in what is good, and blameless in what is evil.
ROM|16|20||And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Messiah, be with you.
ROM|16|21||Timothy, my fellow-laborer, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
ROM|16|22||I Tertius, who have written this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
ROM|16|23||Gaius, hospitable to me and to all the church, saluteth you. Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus a brother, salute you.
ROM|16|24||Now unto God, who is able to establish you, (according to my gospel, which is proclaimed concerning Jesus Messiah; and according to the revelation of the mystery, which was hidden from the times that are past,
ROM|16|25||but is at this time revealed, by means of the scriptures of the prophets; and by the command of the eternal God, is made known to all the Gentiles, for the obedience of faith;)
ROM|16|26||[to him] who only is wise, be glory, through Jesus Messiah, for ever and ever: Amen.
ROM|16|27||The grace of our Lord Jesus Messiah, be with you all: Amen.
1CO|1|1||Paul, called and sent by Jesus Messiah in the good pleasure of God; and Sosthenes, a brother;
1CO|1|2||to the church of God which is at Corinth, to the [people] called and sanctified, who are sanctified in Jesus Messiah; and to all them, in every place, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, their and our [Lord]:
1CO|1|3||Grace [be] with you, and peace; from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Messiah.
1CO|1|4||I thank my God at all times on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given to you in Jesus Messiah;
1CO|1|5||that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all discourse, and in all knowledge;
1CO|1|6||even as the testimony of Messiah was confirmed among you:
1CO|1|7||so that ye are not inferior in any one of his gifts; but are waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Messiah:
1CO|1|8||who will confirm you unto the end, so that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
1CO|1|9||God is faithful; by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Messiah, our Lord.
1CO|1|10||And I beseech you, my Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, that to you all there may be one language; and that there may be no divisions among you: but that ye may become perfectly of one mind, and of one way of thinking.
1CO|1|11||For concerning you, my Brethren, it hath been reported to me by the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1CO|1|12||And this I state: That one of you saith, I am of Paul; and another saith, I am of Apollos; and another saith, I am of Cephas; and another saith, I am of Messiah.
1CO|1|13||Now was Messiah divided? Or was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
1CO|1|14||I thank my God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius;
1CO|1|15||lest any one should say, that I baptized in my own name.
1CO|1|16||I moreover baptized the household of Stephanas: but further, I know not that I baptized any other.
1CO|1|17||For Messiah did not send me to baptize, but to preach; not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Messiah should be inefficient.
1CO|1|18||For a discourse concerning the cross is, to them who perish, foolishness; but to us who live, it is the energy of God.
1CO|1|19||For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and I will dissipate the intelligence of the sagacious.
1CO|1|20||Where is the wise? Or where is the scribe? Or where is the disputant of this world? Lo, hath not God showed, that the wisdom of this world is folly?
1CO|1|21||For in the wisdom of God, because the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of preaching, to quicken them who believe.
1CO|1|22||Because the Jews ask for signs, and the Gentiles demand wisdom.
1CO|1|23||But we preach Messiah as crucified; [which is] a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles;
1CO|1|24||but to them who are called, both Jews and Gentiles, Messiah is the energy of God, and the wisdom of God.
1CO|1|25||Because the foolishness of God, is wiser than men; and the feebleness of God, is stronger than men.
1CO|1|26||For look also at your calling, my Brethren; that not many among you are wise, according to the flesh; and not many among you are mighty, and not many among you are of high birth.
1CO|1|27||But God hath chosen the foolish ones of the world, to shame the wise; and he hath chosen the feeble ones of the world, to shame the mighty;
1CO|1|28||and he hath chosen those of humble birth in the world, and the despised, and them who are nothing, to bring to naught them who are something:
1CO|1|29||so that no flesh might glory before him.
1CO|1|30||And ye, moreover, are of him in Jesus Messiah; who hath become to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
1CO|1|31||according to that which is written: He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1CO|2|1||And I, my Brethren, when I came to you, did not preach to you the mystery of God in magnificent speech, nor in wisdom.
1CO|2|2||And I did not govern myself among you, as if I knew any thing, except only Jesus Messiah; and him also as crucified.
1CO|2|3||And in much fear and much trembling, was I with you.
1CO|2|4||And my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasiveness of the discourses of wisdom; but with the demonstration of the Spirit, and with power:
1CO|2|5||that your faith might not arise from the wisdom of men, but from the power of God.
1CO|2|6||Yet we do speak wisdom, among the perfect; the wisdom not of this world, nor of the potentates of this world, who will come to naught.
1CO|2|7||But we speak the wisdom of God, in a mystery; the wisdom which was hidden, and which God predetermined before the world was, for our glory:
1CO|2|8||which no one of the potentates of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
1CO|2|9||But, as it is written: The eye hath not seen, nor hath the ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man, that which God hath prepared for those who love him.
1CO|2|10||But God hath revealed it to us, by his Spirit; for the Spirit exploreth all things, even the profound things of God.
1CO|2|11||For what man is there, who knoweth that which is in a man, except it be the spirit of the man, which is in him? So also, that which is in God, no one knoweth, except the Spirit of God.
1CO|2|12||Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God; that we might know the free gifts, which are given to us by God.
1CO|2|13||Which things we also speak; not in the teaching of the words of man's wisdom, but in the teaching of the spirit; and we compare spirituals with spirituals.
1CO|2|14||For a man in his natural self, receiveth not spirituals; for they are foolishness to him. Neither can he know them; for they are discerned by the Spirit.
1CO|2|15||But he that is spiritual, judgeth of all things: and he is judged of by no one.
1CO|2|16||For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Messiah.
1CO|3|1||And I, my Brethren, could not talk with you, as with spiritual [persons], but as with the carnal, as with babes in Messiah.
1CO|3|2||I gave you milk, and did not give you solid food: for ye were not then able to receive it; and even now, ye are not able.
1CO|3|3||For ye are still in the flesh. For, as there are among you envying, and contention, and parties, are ye not carnal, and walking in the flesh?
1CO|3|4||For, while one of you saith, I am of Paul; and another saith, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
1CO|3|5||For, who is Paul, or who is Apollos, but the ministers by whom ye believed, each one as the Lord gave to him?
1CO|3|6||I planted, and Apollos watered; but God produced the growth.
1CO|3|7||Not therefore he that planted, is to be accounted of, nor he that watered, but God who produced the growth.
1CO|3|8||And he that planted, and he that watered are on a par; each receiveth his reward, according to his labor.
1CO|3|9||For we labor with God: and ye are God's husbandry, and God's edifice.
1CO|3|10||According to the grace of God which was given me, I laid the foundation like a wise architect; and another buildeth on it. But let each one see, how he buildeth on it.
1CO|3|11||For any other foundation can no man lay, different from that which is laid, which is Jesus Messiah.
1CO|3|12||And if any one buildeth on this foundation, either gold, or silver, or precious stones, or wood, or hay, or stubble;
1CO|3|13||the work of each will be exposed to view; for the day will expose it; because it is to be tested by fire; and the fire will disclose the work of each, of what sort it is.
1CO|3|14||And that builder whose work shall endure, will receive his reward.
1CO|3|15||And he, whose work shall burn up, will suffer loss; yet himself will escape; but it will be, as from the fire.
1CO|3|16||Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God? and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1CO|3|17||Whoever shall mar the temple of God, God will mar him: for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.
1CO|3|18||Let no one deceive himself. Whoever among you thinketh that he is wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
1CO|3|19||For the wisdom of this world is fatuity with God: for it is written, He catcheth the wise in their own craftiness.
1CO|3|20||And again: The Lord knoweth the devices of the wise, that they are vain.
1CO|3|21||Wherefore, let no one glory in men: for all things are yours;
1CO|3|22||whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all things are yours:
1CO|3|23||and ye are Messiah's, and Messiah is God's.
1CO|4|1||Let us be so accounted of by you, as the servants of Messiah, and the stewards of the mysteries of God.
1CO|4|2||Now it is required of stewards, that each be found faithful.
1CO|4|3||But to me, it is a light matter to be judged of by you, or by any man whatever; nay, I am no judge of myself.
1CO|4|4||(For I am not conscious in myself of any thing [flagrant]; yet I am not by this justified; for the Lord is my judge.)
1CO|4|5||Therefore pronounce not judgments before the time, [or] until the Lord come, who will pour light upon the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the thoughts of [men's] hearts: and then will each one have [due] praise from God.
1CO|4|6||These things, my Brethren, I have stated concerning the person of myself and of Apollos, for your sakes; that, in us, ye might learn not to think [of men], above what is written; and that no one might exalt himself in comparison with his fellow, on account of any person.
1CO|4|7||For who exploreth thee? Or what hast thou, which thou didst not receive? And if thou receivedst it, why gloriest thou, as if thou didst not receive it?
1CO|4|8||Now ye are yourselves full, and enriched; and, without us, are on thrones! And I wish ye were enthroned; that we also might reign with you.
1CO|4|9||But I suppose, that God hath placed us legates the last, as for death; since we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men.
1CO|4|10||We are fools, on account of Messiah; but ye are wise in Messiah! We are feeble; but ye are strong! Ye are lauded, we are contemned.
1CO|4|11||Unto this hour, we hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no permanent home:
1CO|4|12||and we toil, working with our own hands: they defame us, and we bless: they persecute us, and we endure it:
1CO|4|13||they revile us, and we entreat them: we are as the filth of the world, and the expiation for all men, up to this time.
1CO|4|14||I write these things, not to shame you; but I instruct you, as dear children.
1CO|4|15||For though ye have a myriad of teachers in Messiah, yet not many fathers; for in Jesus Messiah, I have begotten you by preaching.
1CO|4|16||I beseech you, therefore, that ye be like me.
1CO|4|17||For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, that he might bring to your recollection my ways in Messiah, agreeably to what I teach in all the churches.
1CO|4|18||Now some of you are inflated, as though I would not [dare] come to you.
1CO|4|19||But I will come to you speedily, if God be willing: and I will know, not the speech of them who exalt themselves, but their power:
1CO|4|20||for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1CO|4|21||What will ye? Shall I come to you with the rod, or with love and a gentle spirit?
1CO|5|1||In short, it is reported, there is whoredom among you; and such whoredom as is not even named among the heathen, that a son should even take the wife of his father.
1CO|5|2||And ye are inflated, and have not rather sitten down in grief, that he who hath done this deed might be separated from you.
1CO|5|3||And I, while distant from you in body but present with you in spirit, have already, as if present, judged him who perpetrateth this deed;
1CO|5|4||that ye all assemble together, in the name of our Lord Jesus Messiah, and I with you in spirit, together with the energy of our Lord Jesus Messiah;
1CO|5|5||and that ye deliver him over to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that in spirit he may have life, in the day of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
1CO|5|6||Your glorying is not praiseworthy. Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?
1CO|5|7||Purge out from you the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, as ye are unleavened. For our passover is the Messiah, who was slain for us.
1CO|5|8||Therefore let us celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of wickedness and bitterness, but with the leaven of purity and sanctity.
1CO|5|9||I wrote to you by letter, not to commingle with whoremongers.
1CO|5|10||But I say not, with the whoremongers who are in the world, nor [speak I] of the avaricious, or of the rapacious, or of the idol-worshippers, otherwise ye would be obliged to go out of the world.
1CO|5|11||But this is what I wrote to you, that ye commingle not, if any one is called a brother, and is a whoremonger, or avaricious, or an idol-worshipper, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious, with him who is such, not even to eat bread.
1CO|5|12||For what business have I to judge them who are without? But those within the body, judge ye,
1CO|5|13||and those without, God judgeth; and remove ye the wickedness from among you.
1CO|6|1||Dare any of you, when he hath a controversy with his brother, litigate before the iniquitous, and not before the sanctified?
1CO|6|2||Or know ye not, that the sanctified will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are ye unfit to decide trivial causes?
1CO|6|3||Know ye not, that we shall judge angels? How much more things that are of the world?
1CO|6|4||But if ye have a controversy about a worldly matter, seat ye on the bench for you those who are contemned in the church!
1CO|6|5||For shame to you I say [it]. So, there is not even one wise man among you, who is competent to do equity between a brother and his brother:
1CO|6|6||but a brother litigateth with his brother, and also before them that believe not!
1CO|6|7||Now therefore ye condemn yourselves, in that ye have litigation one with another. For why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why not rather be defrauded?
1CO|6|8||But ye yourselves commit wrong, and ye defraud even your brethren.
1CO|6|9||Or do ye not know, that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not mistake; neither whoremongers, nor idol-worshippers, nor adulterers, nor debauchers, nor liers with males,
1CO|6|10||nor the avaricious, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of God.
1CO|6|11||And these things have been in some of you: but ye are washed, and are sanctified, and made righteous, in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and by the Spirit of our God.
1CO|6|12||Every thing is in my power: but every thing is not profitable to me. Every thing is in my power; but none [of them] shall have dominion over me.
1CO|6|13||Food is for the belly; and the belly is for food; but God will bring them both to naught. But the body is not for whoredom, but for our Lord; and our Lord for the body.
1CO|6|14||And God hath raised up our Lord; and he will raise us up, by his power.
1CO|6|15||Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of the Messiah? Shall one take a member of the Messiah, and make it the member of a harlot? Far be it.
1CO|6|16||Or know ye not, that whoever joineth himself to a harlot, is one body [with her]? For it is said, They twain shall be one body.
1CO|6|17||But he that joineth himself to our Lord, is with him one spirit.
1CO|6|18||Flee whoredom. For every [other] sin which a man committeth, is external to his body; but he that committeth whoredom, sinneth against his own body.
1CO|6|19||Or know ye not, that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who abideth in you, whom ye have received from God? And ye are not your own.
1CO|6|20||For ye are bought with a price. Therefore, glorify ye God, with your body, and with your spirit, which are God's.
1CO|7|1||And concerning the things of which ye wrote to me, it is praiseworthy for a man not to approach a woman.
1CO|7|2||But, on account of whoredom, let each have his own wife and let a woman have her own husband.
1CO|7|3||And let the man render to his wife the kindness which is due; and so also the woman to her husband.
1CO|7|4||The woman is not the sovereign over her body, but her husband: so also the man is not the sovereign over his body, but the wife.
1CO|7|5||Therefore, deprive not one another, except when ye both consent, at the time ye devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and return again to the same disposition, that Satan tempt you not because of the concupiscence of your body.
1CO|7|6||But this I say, as to weak persons, not of positive precept.
1CO|7|7||For I would that all men might be like me in purity. But every man is endowed with his gift of God; one thus, and another so.
1CO|7|8||And I say to them who have no wives, and to widows, that it is advantageous to them to remain as I am.
1CO|7|9||But if they cannot endure [it], let them marry: for it is more profitable to take a wife, than to burn with concupiscence.
1CO|7|10||And on them who have wives, I enjoin,not I, but my Lord,that the woman separate not from her husband.
1CO|7|11||And if she separate, let her remain without a husband, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the man put away his wife.
1CO|7|12||And to the rest, say I, I, not my Lord,that if there be a brother, who hath a wife that believeth not, and she is disposed to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
1CO|7|13||And that woman, who hath a husband that believeth not, and he is disposed to dwell with her let her not forsake her husband.
1CO|7|14||For the husband who believeth not, is sanctified by the wife that believeth; and the wife who believeth not, is sanctified by the husband that believeth: otherwise their children would be impure; but now are they pure.
1CO|7|15||But if the unbeliever separateth, let him separate: A brother or sister is not in bondage in such cases: it is to peace, God hath called us.
1CO|7|16||For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou wilt procure life to thy husband? Or, thou husband, knowest thou, whether thou wilt procure life to thy wife?
1CO|7|17||Every one, however, as the Lord hath distributed to him, and every one as God hath called him, so let him walk. And also thus I enjoin upon all the churches.
1CO|7|18||Is a circumcised person called, let him not revert to uncircumcision: and if one uncircumcised be called, let him not become circumcised.
1CO|7|19||For circumcision is nothing, neither is uncircumcision; but the keeping of God's commands.
1CO|7|20||Let every one continue in the vocation, in which he was called.
1CO|7|21||If thou wert called, being a servant; let it not trouble thee. But if thou canst be made free, choose it rather than to serve.
1CO|7|22||For he that is called by our Lord, being a servant, is God's freedman: likewise, he that is called, being a free man, is the Messiah's servant.
1CO|7|23||Ye are bought with a price; become not the servants of men.
1CO|7|24||Let every one, my Brethren, continue with God, in whatever [state] he was called.
1CO|7|25||And concerning virginity, I have no precept from God; but I give counsels as a man who hath obtained mercy from God to be a believer.
1CO|7|26||And I think this is suitable, on account of the necessity of the times; it is advantageous for a man to remain as he is.
1CO|7|27||Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not a release. Art thou free from a wife? Seek not a wife.
1CO|7|28||But if thou takest a wife, thou sinnest not. And if a maiden is given to a husband, she sinneth not. But they who are such, will have trouble in the body: but I am forbearing to you.
1CO|7|29||And this I say, my Brethren, that the time to come is short; so that they who have wives, should be as if they had none;
1CO|7|30||and they who weep, as if they wept not; and they who rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they who buy, as if they acquired not;
1CO|7|31||and those occupied with this world, not going beyond the just using: for the fashion of this world is passing away.
1CO|7|32||And therefore I wish you to be without solicitude. For he who hath not a wife, considereth the thing of his Lord, how he may please his Lord.
1CO|7|33||And he who hath a wife, is anxious about the world, how he may please his wife.
1CO|7|34||There is a difference also between a wife and a maiden. She who is without a husband, thinketh of things pertaining to her Lord, that she may be holy in her body and in her spirit. But she who hath a husband, thinketh of things pertaining to the world, how she may please her husband.
1CO|7|35||And this I say for your advantage; I am not laying a snare for you; but that ye may be faithful towards your Lord, in a suitable manner, while not minding worldly things.
1CO|7|36||But if any one thinketh that there is reproach, on account of his maiden [daughter], because she hath passed her time, and he hath not presented her to a husband, [and] it be fitting that he present her; let him do what he desireth, he sinneth not; let her be married.
1CO|7|37||But he who hath firmly determined in his own mind, and nothing compelleth him, and he can act his own pleasure, and he so judgeth in his heart, that he keep his maiden [daughter], he doeth commendably.
1CO|7|38||And therefore, he who presenteth his maiden [daughter], doeth commendably; and he who presenteth not his maiden [daughter], doeth very commendably.
1CO|7|39||A woman, while her husband liveth, is bound by the law; but if her husband sleepeth [in death], she is free to marry whom she pleaseth, [yet] only in the Lord.
1CO|7|40||But she is happier, in my opinion, if she remain so: and I think also, that I have the Spirit of God.
1CO|8|1||And concerning sacrifices to idols, we know, that in all of us there is knowledge; and knowledge inflateth, but love edifieth.
1CO|8|2||And if any one thinketh that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to know [it].
1CO|8|3||But if any one loveth God, that man is known of him.
1CO|8|4||As to the eating of the sacrifices of idols, therefore, we know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is no other God, but one.
1CO|8|5||For although there are what are called gods, whether in heaven, or on earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,)
1CO|8|6||yet to us, on our part, there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus the Messiah, by whom are all things, and we also by him.
1CO|8|7||But there is not [this] knowledge in every man; for there are some, who, to the present time, in their conscience, eat [it] as an offering to idols; and because their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
1CO|8|8||But food doth not bring us near to God; for if we eat, we do not abound; and if we eat not, we are not in want.
1CO|8|9||See to it, however, lest this your authority become a stumbling-block to the weak.
1CO|8|10||For if one should see thee in whom there is knowledge, reclining in the temple of idols, will not his conscience, seeing he is a weak person, be encouraged to eat what is sacrificed?
1CO|8|11||And by thy knowledge, he who is feeble, and on account of whom the Messiah died, will perish.
1CO|8|12||And if ye thus sin against your brethren, and wound the consciences of the feeble, ye sin against the Messiah.
1CO|8|13||Wherefore, if food is a stumbling-block to my brother, I will for ever eat no flesh, lest I should be a stumbling-block to my brother.
1CO|9|1||Am I not a free man? Or, am I not a legate? Or, have I not seen Jesus Messiah our Lord? Or, have ye not been my work in my Lord?
1CO|9|2||And if I have not been a legate to others, yet I have been so to you; and ye are the seal of my legateship.
1CO|9|3||And [my] apology to my judgers, is this:
1CO|9|4||Have we not authority, to eat and to drink?
1CO|9|5||Or have we not authority to carry about with us a sister as a wife; just as the other legates, and the brothers of our Lord, and as Cephas?
1CO|9|6||Or I only, and Barnabas, have we no right to forbear labor?
1CO|9|7||Who, that serveth in war, [doth so] at his own expense? Or who, that planteth a vineyard, eateth not of its fruits? Or who, that tendeth sheep, eateth not of the milk of his flocks?
1CO|9|8||Is it as a man, I say these things? Behold, the law also saith them.
1CO|9|9||For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that thresheth. Hath God regard for oxen?
1CO|9|10||But manifest it is, for whose sake he said it. And indeed, for our sakes it was written: because the plougher ought to plough in hope, and the thresher in hope of fruit.
1CO|9|11||If we have sowed among you the things of the Spirit, is it a great matter, if we reap from you the things of the body?
1CO|9|12||And if others have this prerogative over you, doth it not belong still more to us? Yet we have not used this prerogative; but we have endured every thing, that we might in nothing impede the announcement of the Messiah.
1CO|9|13||Know ye not, that they who serve in a temple, are fed from the temple? And they who serve at the altar, participate with the altar?
1CO|9|14||Thus also hath our Lord commanded, that they who proclaim his gospel, should live by his gospel.
1CO|9|15||But I have used none of these things: and I write not, that it may be so done to me; for it would be better for me to actually die, than that any one should make void my glorying.
1CO|9|16||For while I preach, I have no [ground of] glorying; because necessity is laid upon me, and woe to me, if I preach not.
1CO|9|17||For if I do this voluntarily, there is a reward for me: but if involuntarily, a stewardship is intrusted to me.
1CO|9|18||What then is my reward? [It is,] that when I preach, I make the announcement of the Messiah without cost, and use not the prerogative given me in the gospel.
1CO|9|19||Being free from them all, I have made myself servant to every man; that I might gain many:
1CO|9|20||and with the Jews, I was as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; and with those under the law, I was as under the law, that I might gain them who are under the law;
1CO|9|21||and to those who have not the law, I was as without the law, (although I am not without law to God, but under the law of the Messiah,) that I might gain them that are without the law.
1CO|9|22||I was with the weak, as weak, that I might gain the weak: I was all things to all men, that I might vivify every one.
1CO|9|23||And this I do, that I may participate in the announcement.
1CO|9|24||Know ye not that they who run in the stadium, run all of them; yet it is one who gaineth the victory. Run ye, so as to attain.
1CO|9|25||For every one who engageth in the contest, restraineth his desires in every thing. And they run, to obtain a crown that perisheth; but we, one that perisheth not.
1CO|9|26||I therefore so run, not as for something unknown; and I so struggle, not as struggling against air;
1CO|9|27||but I subdue my body, and reduce it to servitude; lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a reprobate.
1CO|10|1||And, my Brethren, I would have you know, that our fathers were all of them under the cloud, and they all passed through the sea;
1CO|10|2||and they were all baptized by Moses, in the cloud and in the sea;
1CO|10|3||and they all ate the same spiritual food;
1CO|10|4||and they all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that attended them, and that rock was the Messiah.
1CO|10|5||But with a multitude of them, God was not pleased; for they fell in the wilderness.
1CO|10|6||Now these things were an example for us, that we should not hanker after evil things as they hankered.
1CO|10|7||Neither should we serve idols, as some of them served; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to sport.
1CO|10|8||Neither let us commit whoredom, as some of them committed; and there fell in one day twenty and three thousand.
1CO|10|9||Neither let us tempt the Messiah, as some of them tempted; and serpents destroyed them.
1CO|10|10||Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured; and they perished by the destroyer.
1CO|10|11||All these things which befell them, were for an example to us; and they are written for our instruction, on whom the end of the world hath come.
1CO|10|12||Wherefore, let him who thinketh he standeth, beware lest he fall.
1CO|10|13||No trial cometh on you, but what pertaineth to men: and God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tried beyond your ability, but will make an issue to your trial, that ye may be able to sustain it.
1CO|10|14||Wherefore, my Beloved, flee from idolatry.
1CO|10|15||I speak as to the wise; judge ye what I say.
1CO|10|16||The cup of thanksgiving which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of the Messiah? And the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Messiah?
1CO|10|17||As therefore that bread is one, so we are all one body; for we all take to ourselves from that one bread.
1CO|10|18||Behold the Israel who are in the flesh; are not they who eat the victims, participators of the altar?
1CO|10|19||What then do I say? That an idol is any thing? Or, that an idol's sacrifice is any thing? No.
1CO|10|20||But that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. And I would not, that ye should be associates of demons.
1CO|10|21||Ye cannot drink the cup of our Lord, and the cup of demons; and ye cannot be partakers at the table of our Lord, and at the table of demons.
1CO|10|22||Or, would we sedulously provoke our Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1CO|10|23||Every thing is in my power; but every thing is not profitable. Every thing is in my power; but every thing doth not edify.
1CO|10|24||Let no one seek his own things, but also the things of his fellow-man.
1CO|10|25||Whatever is sold in the flesh-market, eat ye, without an inquiry on account of conscience:
1CO|10|26||for the earth is the Lord's, in its fullness.
1CO|10|27||And if one of the Gentiles invite you, and ye are disposed to go, eat ye whatever is set before you, without an inquiry on account of conscience.
1CO|10|28||But if any one shall say to you, This pertaineth to a sacrifice; eat not, for the sake of him who told you, and for conscience's sake.
1CO|10|29||The conscience I speak of, is not your own, but his who told you. But why is my liberty judged of, by the conscience of others?
1CO|10|30||If I by grace partake, why am I reproached for that, for which I give thanks?
1CO|10|31||If therefore ye eat, or if ye drink, or if ye do any thing, do all things for the glory of God.
1CO|10|32||Be ye without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:
1CO|10|33||even as I also, in every thing, please every man; and do not seek what is profitable to me, but what is profitable to many; that they may live.
1CO|11|1||Be ye imitators of me, as I am of the Messiah.
1CO|11|2||Moreover I commend you, my Brethren, that in all things ye are mindful of me, and that ye hold fast the precepts as I delivered them to you.
1CO|11|3||And I would have you know, that the head of every man is the Messiah, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of the Messiah is God.
1CO|11|4||Every man, who prayeth or prophesieth with his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
1CO|11|5||And every woman, who prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head; for she is on a level with her whose head is shaven.
1CO|11|6||For if a woman be not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it be shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
1CO|11|7||The man, indeed, ought not to cover his head, because he is the likeness and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1CO|11|8||For the man was not from the woman, but the woman from the man.
1CO|11|9||Neither was the man created for the woman's sake, but the woman for the man's sake.
1CO|11|10||For this cause ought the woman to have on her head [the mark of] authority, because of the angels.
1CO|11|11||Nevertheless, the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in our Lord.
1CO|11|12||For as the woman [was] from the man, so the man is by the woman; and every thing is from God.
1CO|11|13||Judge for yourselves, among yourselves; is it becoming, that a woman pray to God with her head uncovered?
1CO|11|14||Doth not nature teach you, that in a man, if his hair groweth long, it is a reproach to him?
1CO|11|15||But for a woman, if her hair is abundant, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.
1CO|11|16||But if any one is contentious about these things, we on our part have no such custom, nor hath the church of God.
1CO|11|17||This which I now enjoin, is not as praising you; for ye have not made progress, but have deteriorated.
1CO|11|18||Because, first; when ye assemble in the church, there are, I hear, divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
1CO|11|19||For there are to be contentions among you, that the approved among you may be known.
1CO|11|20||When therefore ye come together, ye eat and drink, not as is becoming on the day of our Lord.
1CO|11|21||But, one and another proceedeth to eat his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1CO|11|22||What! have ye no houses in which ye can eat and drink? Or, despise ye the church of God, and shame them who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.
1CO|11|23||For I have received from our Lord, that which I imparted to you; that our Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
1CO|11|24||and blessed, and brake [it], and said: "Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for your sakes: thus do ye, in remembrance of me."
1CO|11|25||So, after they had supped, he gave also the cup, and said: "This cup is the new testament in my blood: thus do ye, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me."
1CO|11|26||For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye commemorate the death of our Lord, until his advent.
1CO|11|27||He therefore, who eateth of the bread of the Lord, and drinketh of his cup, and is not worthy of it, is guilty of the blood of the Lord, and of his body.
1CO|11|28||For this reason, a man should examine himself, and then eat of this bread, and drink of this cup:
1CO|11|29||for, whoever eateth and drinketh of it, while he is unworthy, eateth and drinketh condemnation on himself, by not discerning the body of the Lord.
1CO|11|30||For this cause, many among you are diseased and sickly, and many sleep.
1CO|11|31||For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
1CO|11|32||But when we are judged by our Lord, we are really chastised, that we may not be condemned with the world.
1CO|11|33||Wherefore, my Brethren, when ye assemble to eat, wait ye one for another.
1CO|11|34||And let him who is hungry, eat at home; that ye may assemble, not for condemnation. And as to other things, I will give you directions when I come.
1CO|12|1||And concerning spirituals, my brethren, I would have you know,
1CO|12|2||that ye have been pagans; and have been, without distinction, led away after idols, in which there is no speech.
1CO|12|3||I therefore inform you, that there is no man, that speaketh by the Spirit of God, who saith that Jesus is accursed: neither can a man say that Jesus is the Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO|12|4||Now there are diversities of gifts; but the Spirit is one.
1CO|12|5||And there are diversities of ministrations; but the Lord is one.
1CO|12|6||And there are diversities of energies; but God, who worketh all in all men, is one.
1CO|12|7||And to each man, there is given a manifestation of the Spirit, that it may aid him.
1CO|12|8||To one, by the Spirit, there is given a word of wisdom; and to another, by the same Spirit, there is given a word of knowledge:
1CO|12|9||to another, by the same Spirit, faith: to another, by the same Spirit, gifts of healing:
1CO|12|10||and to another, miracles: and to another, prophecy: and to another, the discerning of spirits: and to another, [divers] kinds of tongues: and to another, the interpretation of tongues.
1CO|12|11||But all these, worketh that one Spirit; and he distributeth to every one as he pleaseth.
1CO|12|12||For as the body is one, and in it are many members; and all those members of the body, though many, are one body; so also is the Messiah.
1CO|12|13||For all of us, likewise, by one Spirit, have been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free; and all of us have drinked in one Spirit.
1CO|12|14||For a body also, is not one member, but many.
1CO|12|15||For if the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it, on that account, not of the body?
1CO|12|16||Or if the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it, on that account, not of the body?
1CO|12|17||And if the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? Or if it were all hearing, where would be the smelling?
1CO|12|18||But now hath God placed every one of the members in the body, according to his pleasure.
1CO|12|19||And if they were all one member, where would be the body?
1CO|12|20||But now they are many members, yet but one body.
1CO|12|21||The eye cannot say to the hand, Thou art not needful to me: nor can the head say to the feet, Ye are not needful to me.
1CO|12|22||But rather, those members which are accounted feeble, are indispensable.
1CO|12|23||And those which we think dishonorable in the body, on them we heap more honor; and those that are uncomely, on them we put the more decoration.
1CO|12|24||For the honorable members in us, have no need of honor: for God hath tempered the body, and given more honor to the member which is inferior;
1CO|12|25||that there might be no disunion in the body, but that all the members, equally, might care for one another;
1CO|12|26||so that, when one member is in pain, they will all sympathize; and if one member is exalted, all the members will be exalted.
1CO|12|27||Now ye are the body of Messiah, and members in your place.
1CO|12|28||For God hath placed in his church, first, legates; after them, prophets; after them, teachers; after them, workers of miracles; after them, the gifts of healing, and helpers, and leaders, and [various] kinds of tongues.
1CO|12|29||Are they all legates? Are they all prophets? Are they all teachers? Are they all workers of miracles?
1CO|12|30||Have all of them the gifts of healing? Do they all speak with tongues? Or do they all interpret?
1CO|12|31||And if ye are emulous of the superior gifts, on the other hand, I show to you a better way.
1CO|13|1||If I could speak in every tongue of men, and in that of angels, and there should be no love in me, I should be like brass that resoundeth, or the cymbal that maketh a noise.
1CO|13|2||And if there should be in me [the gift of] prophecy, and I should understand all the mysteries, and every science; and if there should be in me all faith, so that I could move mountains, and love should not be in me, I should be nothing.
1CO|13|3||And if I should feed out to the destitute all I possess; and if I should give my body to be burned; and there should be no love in me, I gain nothing.
1CO|13|4||Love is long-suffering, and is kind; love is not envious; love is not boisterous; and is not inflated;
1CO|13|5||and doth nothing that causeth shame; and seeketh not her own; is not passionate; and thinketh no evil;
1CO|13|6||rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
1CO|13|7||beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all, and endureth all.
1CO|13|8||Love will never cease. But prophesyings will end; and tongues will be silent; and knowledge will vanish.
1CO|13|9||For we know but partially; and we prophesy but partially.
1CO|13|10||But when completeness shall come, then that which is partial will vanish away.
1CO|13|11||When I was a child, I talked as a child, and I reasoned as a child, and I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I laid aside the things of childhood.
1CO|13|12||And now we see, as by a mirror, in similitude; but then face to face: now I know partially; but then shall I know, just as I am known.
1CO|13|13||For these three things are abiding, faith, and hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
1CO|14|1||Follow after love; and be emulous of the gifts of the Spirit, and especially, that ye may prophesy.
1CO|14|2||For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no one understandeth what is said; yet in the spirit, he speaketh a mystery.
1CO|14|3||But he that prophesieth, speaketh unto men, for edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
1CO|14|4||He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: and he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.
1CO|14|5||Now I would that ye all spoke with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh in a tongue, unless he interpret; and if he interpret, he edifieth the church.
1CO|14|6||And now, my brethren, if I should come among you, and speak to you in tongues, what should I profit you; unless I should speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?
1CO|14|7||For even inanimate things that emit sound, whether pipe or harp, if they make no distinction between one sound and another, how will it be known, what is sung or what is harped?
1CO|14|8||And if the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
1CO|14|9||So likewise if ye utter a discourse in a tongue, and there is no interpretation given, how will it be known what ye have said? Ye will have been as if ye spoke into the air.
1CO|14|10||For lo, there are many kinds of tongues in the world; and there is not one of them without meaning.
1CO|14|11||But if I do not know the import of the sound, I shall be a barbarian to him that speaketh, and the speaker will be a barbarian to me.
1CO|14|12||So also ye, since ye are emulous of the gifts of the Spirit for the edification of the church, seek ye to excel.
1CO|14|13||And let him that speaketh in a tongue, pray that he may interpret.
1CO|14|14||For if I should pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruits.
1CO|14|15||What then shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, and will pray with my understanding; and I will sing with my spirit, and will sing with my understanding.
1CO|14|16||Otherwise, if thou blessest in the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of one unlearned, say Amen, on thy giving thanks; for he knoweth not what thou sayest?
1CO|14|17||Thou blessest, indeed, very well; but thy neighbor is not edified.
1CO|14|18||I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than all of you.
1CO|14|19||But in the church, I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others, than a myriad of words in a tongue.
1CO|14|20||My brethren, be ye not children in your thoughts; but to evil things be ye infants; and in your thoughts be men.
1CO|14|21||In the law it is written, With a foreign speech, and in another tongue, will I speak with this people; and even so also they will not hearken to me, saith the Lord.
1CO|14|22||Wherefore, tongues are established for a sign, not to the believers, but to them that believe not. But prophesyings are not for those who believe not, but for them that believe.
1CO|14|23||If therefore the whole church assemble, and they all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons, or such as believe not, will they not say: These people are crazy?
1CO|14|24||But if ye should be all prophesying, and one unlearned or an unbeliever should come among you, he is explored by you all, and rebuked by you all;
1CO|14|25||and the secrets of his heart are laid open [to him]: and so he will fall upon his face, and will worship God, and say: Verily, God is in you.
1CO|14|26||I therefore say [to you] my brethren, that when ye assemble, whoever of you hath a psalm, let him speak; and whoever hath a doctrine, and whoever hath a revelation, and whoever hath a tongue, and whoever hath an interpretation. Let them all be for edification.
1CO|14|27||And if any speak in a tongue, let two speak or at most, three; and let them speak one by one; and let [some] one interpret.
1CO|14|28||And if there is none to interpret, let him that speaketh in a tongue, be silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.
1CO|14|29||And as to prophets, let two or three speak, and let the rest judge.
1CO|14|30||And if to another sitting by, there should be a revelation, let the first stop speaking.
1CO|14|31||For ye can all prophesy, one by one; so that every one may learn, and every one be comforted.
1CO|14|32||For the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.
1CO|14|33||Because, God is not [the author] of tumult, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
1CO|14|34||Let your women be silent in the church: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection, as also the law saith.
1CO|14|35||And if they wish to be informed on any subject, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is unbecoming for women to speak in the church.
1CO|14|36||What! was it from you that the word of God came forth? Or did it reach only to you?
1CO|14|37||And if any one among you thinketh that he is a prophet, or that he is spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, as being the precepts of our Lord.
1CO|14|38||But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1CO|14|39||Wherefore, my brethren, be emulous of prophesying: and to speak with tongues, prohibit not.
1CO|14|40||But let every thing be done with decency and regularity.
1CO|15|1||And I make known to you, my brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, and which ye received, and in which ye stand,
1CO|15|2||and by which ye have life. In what terms I preached to you, ye remember; unless ye have believed in vain.
1CO|15|3||For I delivered to you from the first, as I had received it; that the Messiah died on account of our sins, as it is written:
1CO|15|4||and that he was buried and arose on the third day, as it is written:
1CO|15|5||and that he was seen by Cephas; and after him, by the twelve:
1CO|15|6||and after that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once; many of whom survive at the present time, and some of them sleep.
1CO|15|7||And subsequently to this, he was seen by James; and after him, by all the legates.
1CO|15|8||And last of them all, he was seen by me, as it were by an abortion.
1CO|15|9||I am the least of the legates; and am not worthy to be called a legate; because I persecuted the church of God.
1CO|15|10||But by the grace of God, I am what I am: and his grace, that was in me, was not in vain; but I labored more than they all:not I, but his grace that was with me.
1CO|15|11||Whether I, therefore, or whether they, so we preached; and so ye believed.
1CO|15|12||And if the Messiah is proclaimed, as rising from the dead; how is it that there are some among you, who say, There is no reviviscence of the dead?
1CO|15|13||And if there is no reviviscence of the dead, the Messiah also hath not risen.
1CO|15|14||And if the Messiah hath not risen, our preaching is vain, and your faith also vain.
1CO|15|15||And we too are found false witnesses of God; for we have testified concerning God, that he raised up the Messiah, when he did not raise him up.
1CO|15|16||For, if the dead will not arise, the Messiah also hath not risen.
1CO|15|17||And if the Messiah rose not, your faith is inane; and ye are yet in your sins:
1CO|15|18||and also, doubtless, they who have fallen asleep in the Messiah, have perished.
1CO|15|19||And if, in this life only, we have hope in the Messiah, we are the most miserable of all men.
1CO|15|20||But now the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.
1CO|15|21||And as by a man came death, so also by a man came the reviviscence of the dead.
1CO|15|22||For as it was by Adam, that all men die, so also by the Messiah they all live:
1CO|15|23||every one in his order; the Messiah was the first-fruits; afterwards, they that are the Messiah's, at his coming.
1CO|15|24||And then will be the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God the Father; when every prince, and every sovereign, and all powers shall have come to naught.
1CO|15|25||For he is to reign, until he shall put all his enemies under his feet.
1CO|15|26||And the last enemy, death, will be abolished.
1CO|15|27||For he hath subjected all under his feet. But when he said, that every thing is subjected to him, it is manifest that he is excepted, who subjected all to him.
1CO|15|28||And when all shall be subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subject to him who subjected all to him, so that God will be all in all.
1CO|15|29||Otherwise, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? Why are they baptized for the dead?
1CO|15|30||And why also do we stand every hour in peril?
1CO|15|31||I protest, my brethren, by your exultation, which is mine in our Lord Jesus the Messiah, that I die daily.
1CO|15|32||If, as amongst men, I was cast to wild beasts at Ephesus, what did it profit me, if the dead rise not? "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die."
1CO|15|33||Be not deceived; "Evil stories corrupt well-disposed minds."
1CO|15|34||Let your hearts be righteously excited, and sin not: for there are some, in whom is not the love of God: it is to your shame, I say it.
1CO|15|35||But some one of you may say: How will the dead arise? and with what body will they come forth?
1CO|15|36||Foolish man! The seed which thou sowest, is not quickened, unless it die.
1CO|15|37||And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that is to be, but the naked kernel of wheat or barley, or of the other grains:
1CO|15|38||and God giveth it a body, as he pleaseth; and to each of the grains its natural body.
1CO|15|39||And every body is not alike; for the body of a man is one thing, and that of a beast is another, and that of a bird is another, and that of a fish is another.
1CO|15|40||And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of the celestial [bodies] is one, and that of the terrestrial is another.
1CO|15|41||And the glory of the sun is one thing, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another; and one star exceedeth another star in glory.
1CO|15|42||So also in the reviviscence of the dead. They are sown in corruption, they arise without corruption:
1CO|15|43||they are sown in dishonor, they arise in glory: they are sown in weakness, they arise in power:
1CO|15|44||it is sown an animal body, it ariseth a spiritual body. For there is a body of the animal life, and there is a body of the spirit.
1CO|15|45||So also is it written: "Adam, the first man, became a living soul;" the second Adam [became] a quickening spirit.
1CO|15|46||And the spiritual was not first; but the animal, and then the spiritual.
1CO|15|47||The first man was of dust from the earth; the second man was the Lord from heaven.
1CO|15|48||As he was of the dust, so also those who are of the dust; and as was he who was from heaven, so also are the heavenly.
1CO|15|49||And as we have worn the likeness of him from the dust, so shall we wear the likeness of him from heaven.
1CO|15|50||But this I say, my brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven: neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO|15|51||Lo, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1CO|15|52||suddenly, as in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, when it shall sound; and the dead will arise, without corruption; and we shall be changed.
1CO|15|53||For this which is corruptible, is to put on incorruption; and that which dieth, will put on immortality.
1CO|15|54||And when this that is corruptible, shall put on incorruption, and this that dieth, immortality; then will take place the word that is written, "Death is absorbed in victory."
1CO|15|55||Where is thy sting, O death? And where is thy victory, O grave?
1CO|15|56||Now the sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
1CO|15|57||But thanks be to God, that giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
1CO|15|58||Wherefore, my brethren and my beloved, be ye steadfast, and be not vacillating; but be ye at all times abundant in the work of the Lord; seeing ye know, that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
1CO|16|1||And as to the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of the Galatians, so do ye.
1CO|16|2||On each first day of the week, let every one of you lay aside and preserve at home, what he is able; that there may be no collections when I come.
1CO|16|3||And when I come, those whom ye shall select, I will send with a letter, to carry your bounty to Jerusalem.
1CO|16|4||And if it should be suitable that I also go, they shall go with me.
1CO|16|5||And I will come to you, when I pass from Macedonia; for I am about to pass through Macedonia.
1CO|16|6||And perhaps I shall remain with you, or winter with you; that ye may accompany me whither I go.
1CO|16|7||For I am not disposed to see you now, as I pass along; because I hope to spend some time with you, if my Lord permit me.
1CO|16|8||For I shall continue at Ephesus until Pentecost:
1CO|16|9||because a great door is opened to me, which is full of occupations; and the opposers are numerous.
1CO|16|10||And if Timothy come to you, see that he may be without fear among you; for he doeth the work of the Lord, as I do.
1CO|16|11||Therefore, let no one despise him; but conduct him on in peace, that he may come to me; for I wait for him with the brethren.
1CO|16|12||As for Apollos, my brethren, I entreated him much to go with the brethren to you; but his inclination was not to go to you now; but when he shall have opportunity, he will go to you.
1CO|16|13||Watch ye, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be valiant.
1CO|16|14||Let all your affairs be conducted with love.
1CO|16|15||I beseech you, my brethren, concerning the household of Stephanas; (for ye know, that they were the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to ministering to the saints;)
1CO|16|16||that ye also give ear to them who are such; and to every one, that laboreth with us and aideth.
1CO|16|17||And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have supplied that wherein ye were deficient towards me.
1CO|16|18||And they have refreshed my spirit, and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them who are such.
1CO|16|19||All the churches that are in Asia, salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church in their house, salute you much in the Lord.
1CO|16|20||All the brethren salute you. Salute ye one another with a holy kiss.
1CO|16|21||The salutation in the handwriting of myself, Paul.
1CO|16|22||Whoever loveth not our Lord Jesus the Messiah, let him be accursed: our Lord cometh.
1CO|16|23||The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah be with you.
1CO|16|24||And my love be with you all, in the Messiah, Jesus. Amen.
2CO|1|1||Paul a legate of Jesus the Messiah, by the good pleasure of God; and Timothy a brother; to the church of God that is at Corinth, and to all the saints that are in all Achaia.
2CO|1|2||Grace be with you, and peace, from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2CO|1|3||Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation;
2CO|1|4||who comforteth us in all our afflictions, that we also might be able to comfort those who are in all afflictions, with the consolation wherewith we are comforted by God.
2CO|1|5||For, as the sufferings of the Messiah abound in us, so also our consolation aboundeth by the Messiah.
2CO|1|6||And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and for your life that we are afflicted; or whether we be comforted, it is, that ye may be comforted; and that there may be in you an eagerness, wherewith ye may endure those sufferings which we also suffer.
2CO|1|7||And our hope concerning you is steadfast: for we know, that if ye partake of the sufferings, ye will also partake of the consolation.
2CO|1|8||But, my brethren, we wish you to know, respecting the affliction that was upon us in Asia, that we were afflicted exceedingly, beyond our strength, insomuch that our life was ready to terminate.
2CO|1|9||And we passed a sentence of death upon ourselves, that our confidence might not be in ourselves, but in God, who raiseth up the dead;
2CO|1|10||who rescued us from imminent death: and we hope that he will again rescue us,
2CO|1|11||by the aid of your prayers in our behalf; so that his gift to us may be a favor done for the sake of many, and many may praise him on our account.
2CO|1|12||For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and purity, and by the grace of God, and not in the wisdom of the flesh, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially towards you.
2CO|1|13||We write no other things unto you, than those which ye know and acknowledge. And I trust, ye will acknowledge them to the end:
2CO|1|14||as ye have also partially acknowledged that we are your rejoicing, as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2CO|1|15||And in this confidence, I was before disposed to come to you, that ye might receive the grace doubly;
2CO|1|16||and to pass by you into Macedonia, and again to come to you from Macedonia, and [so] ye would accompany me to Judaea.
2CO|1|17||When therefore I thus purposed, did I purpose as one inconsiderate? Or, were the things I purposed, things of the flesh; so that there should be in them Yes, yes, and No, no?
2CO|1|18||God is the witness, that our word to you was not Yes and No.
2CO|1|19||For the Son of God, Jesus the Messiah, who was preached to you by us, [namely,] by me, by Sylvanus, and by Timotheus, was not Yes and No; but it was Yes in him.
2CO|1|20||For all the promises of God in him, the Messiah, are Yes; for which cause, we through him give [our] Amen, to the glory of God.
2CO|1|21||Now it is God who establisheth us, with you, in the Messiah, and hath anointed us,
2CO|1|22||and hath sealed us, and hath given the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts.
2CO|1|23||Moreover, I call God for a witness on my soul, that it was in order to spare you, that I came not to Corinth.
2CO|1|24||Not that we are lords over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for it is by faith ye stand.
2CO|2|1||And I determined this with myself, that I would not again come to you in sadness.
2CO|2|2||For if I should make you sad, who would make me joyful, unless he whom I had made sad?
2CO|2|3||And I wrote that very thing to you, lest when I came, those persons whom I ought to make joyful, should make me sad. For I have confidence concerning you, that my joy is the joy of you all.
2CO|2|4||And in much affliction, and in anguish of heart, I wrote those things to you, with many tears; not that ye might have sorrow, but that ye might know the exceeding love I have for you.
2CO|2|5||And if one hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me [only], but,that the declaration may not bear too hard on youin a measure, all of you.
2CO|2|6||And sufficient for him, is this rebuke proceeding from many:
2CO|2|7||so that, on the other hand, ye ought to forgive him and console him; lest he who is such a man, should be swallowed up with excessive grief.
2CO|2|8||I therefore beseech you, that ye confirm to him your love.
2CO|2|9||For it was for this also that I wrote [to you], that I might learn by a trial, whether ye would be obedient in every thing.
2CO|2|10||And whom ye forgive, I also [forgive]: for that which I forgave to any one, for your sakes I forgave it, in the presence of the Messiah;
2CO|2|11||lest Satan should overreach us; for we know his devices.
2CO|2|12||Moreover, when I came to Troas in announcing the Messiah, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,
2CO|2|13||there was no quietude in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: and I took leave of them, and went into Macedonia.
2CO|2|14||But thanks be to God, who always procureth us a triumph in the Messiah, and manifesteth by us the odor of the knowledge of him in every place.
2CO|2|15||For, through the Messiah, we are unto God a sweet odor, in them that live and in them that perish:
2CO|2|16||to these, an odor of death unto death; and to those, an odor of life unto life. And who is adequate to these things!
2CO|2|17||For we are not like others, who dilute the words of God; but as of the truth, and as of God, we speak in the Messiah before God.
2CO|3|1||Do we begin again to show you who we are? Or do we, like others, need that letters recommendatory of us should be written to you? Or, that ye should write recommendations of us?
2CO|3|2||Ye are our epistle, written on our hearts, and known and read by every man.
2CO|3|3||For ye know that ye are an epistle of the Messiah, ministered by us; not written with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on the tablets of the heart of flesh.
2CO|3|4||And such confidence have we in the Messiah towards God.
2CO|3|5||Not that we are sufficient to think any thing as of ourselves; but our efficiency is from God:
2CO|3|6||who hath fitted us to be ministers of the new Testament, not in the letter, but in the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.
2CO|3|7||Now if the ministration of death was engraved upon stones in writing, and was so glorious that the children of Israel could not look on the face of Moses, on account of the glory upon his face which vanished away;
2CO|3|8||how then shall not the ministration of the Spirit be still more glorious?
2CO|3|9||For if there was glory in the ministration of condemnation, how much more shall the ministration of justification excel in glory?
2CO|3|10||For that which was glorious, was as if not glorious, in comparison with this which excelleth in glory.
2CO|3|11||For if that which is abolished was glorious, much more must that which abideth be glorious.
2CO|3|12||Seeing therefore we have this hope, we the more speak with boldness;
2CO|3|13||and are not like Moses, who threw a vail over his face, that the children of Israel might not behold the termination of that which was abolished.
2CO|3|14||But they were blinded in their understanding; for until this day, when the old Testament is read, the same vail resteth upon them; nor is it manifest [to them], that it is abolished by the Messiah.
2CO|3|15||And unto this day, when Moses is read, a vail is thrown upon their hearts.
2CO|3|16||But when any of them is turned unto the Lord, the vail is taken from him.
2CO|3|17||Now the Lord himself is the Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
2CO|3|18||And we all, with uncovered faces, behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord; and are transformed into the same likeness, from glory to glory, as by the Lord the Spirit.
2CO|4|1||Therefore, we are not weary in this ministry which we have received, according to the mercies that have been upon us:
2CO|4|2||But we have renounced the concealments of dishonor, and we walk not in craftiness, nor do we treat the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, we exhibit ourselves to all the consciences of men before God.
2CO|4|3||And if our gospel is vailed, it is vailed to them that perish;
2CO|4|4||to them whose minds the God of this world hath blinded, in order that they might not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of the Messiah (who is the likeness of God) should dawn upon them.
2CO|4|5||For it is not ourselves that we preach, but the Messiah, Jesus our Lord; and, as to ourselves, that we are your servants for Jesus' sake.
2CO|4|6||Because God, who commanded the light to arise from darkness, hath himself shined in our hearts, that we might be illuminated with the knowledge of the glory of God on the face of Jesus the Messiah.
2CO|4|7||But we have this treasure in an earthen vessel, that the excellency of the power might be from God, and not from us.
2CO|4|8||And in every thing we are oppressed, but not suffocated; we are corrected, but not condemned;
2CO|4|9||we are persecuted, but not forsaken; we are prostrated, but perish not.
2CO|4|10||For we bear in our body, at all times, the dying of Jesus; that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.
2CO|4|11||For if we are delivered over alive unto death, for Jesus' sake, even so also will the life of Jesus be manifested in this our mortal body.
2CO|4|12||Now therefore, in us death is active, but in you, life.
2CO|4|13||Having therefore the same spirit of faith, (as it is written, I believed, therefore also have I spoken,) we also believe, and therefore speak;
2CO|4|14||knowing that he, who resuscitated our Lord Jesus, will also resuscitate us by Jesus, and will receive us, with you, to himself.
2CO|4|15||For all things are for your sakes, that while grace aboundeth by means of many, thanksgiving may abound to the glory of God.
2CO|4|16||For this cause we faint not; for though our outward man perish, yet the inner [man] is renovated day by day.
2CO|4|17||For the affliction of the present time, though very small and light, prepareth for us great glory, without end, for ever and ever;
2CO|4|18||while we look not at these seen things, but at those not seen; for these seen things are temporary, but those not seen are eternal.
2CO|5|1||For we know that, if our house on earththis of the body, were dissolved, yet we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.
2CO|5|2||And on this account also, we groan, and wish to be clothed with our house from heaven:
2CO|5|3||if indeed, when clothed, we shall not be found naked.
2CO|5|4||For while we are here in this house, we groan under its burden; yet ye desire, not to throw it off; but to be clothed over it, so that its mortality may be absorbed in life.
2CO|5|5||And he that prepareth us for this thing, is God: who hath given us the earnest of his Spirit.
2CO|5|6||Therefore, because we know and are persuaded, that while we lodge in the body we sojourn away from our Lord;
2CO|5|7||(for we walk by faith, and not by sight;)
2CO|5|8||therefore we are confident, and desirous to be away from the body, and to be with our Lord.
2CO|5|9||We are assiduous, that whether we are absent, or whether at home, we may please him.
2CO|5|10||For we are all to stand before the judgment-seat of the Messiah, that each may receive retribution in the body, [for] what he hath done in it, whether of good, or whether of evil.
2CO|5|11||Therefore because we know the fear of our Lord we persuade men; and we are made manifest unto God; and I hope also, we are made manifest to your minds.
2CO|5|12||We do not again laud ourselves to you; but we give you occasion to glory in us, to them who glory in appearance and not in heart.
2CO|5|13||For if we are extravagant, it is for God: and if we are discreet, it is for you.
2CO|5|14||For the love of the Messiah constraineth us to reason thus: One died for all; therefore are all dead.
2CO|5|15||And he died for all, that they who live should not live to themselves, but to him who died for them and rose again.
2CO|5|16||And therefore, we know no person after the flesh: and if we have known the Messiah after the flesh, yet henceforth we know [him] no more.
2CO|5|17||Whoever therefore is in the Messiah, is a new creature: old things have passed away;
2CO|5|18||and all things are made new, by God; who hath reconciled us to himself by the Messiah, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.
2CO|5|19||For God was in the Messiah, who hath reconciled the world with his majesty, and did not reckon to them their sins; and who hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.
2CO|5|20||We are therefore ambassadors for the Messiah, and it is as if God was beseeching you by us. In behalf of the Messiah, therefore, we beseech [you], be ye reconciled to God.
2CO|5|21||For, on your account, he hath made him who knew no sin to be sin, that we might by him become the righteousness of God.
2CO|6|1||And as aiders we entreat of you, that the grace of God which ye have received, may not be ineffectual in you.
2CO|6|2||For he hath said, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in the day of life I have aided thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time! and behold, now is the day of life!
2CO|6|3||Give ye no occasion of offence to any one in any thing, that there may be no reproach on our ministry.
2CO|6|4||But we, in all things, would show ourselves to be the ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessity, in distresses,
2CO|6|5||in scourgings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in toil, in watching, in fasting;
2CO|6|6||by purity, by knowledge, by long suffering, by benignity, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned,
2CO|6|7||by the speaking of truth, by the energy of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left;
2CO|6|8||amid honor and dishonor, amid praise and contumely; as deceivers, and yet true;
2CO|6|9||as not known, and yet we are well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastised, yet not killed;
2CO|6|10||as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as indigent, yet enriching many; as possessing nothing, yet having all things.
2CO|6|11||O ye Corinthians, our mouth is opened towards you, and our heart expanded.
2CO|6|12||Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
2CO|6|13||I speak as to [my] children, Pay me the debt which ye owe, and expand your love towards me.
2CO|6|14||And be ye not yoke-fellows with them that believe not: for what fellowship hath righteousness with iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?
2CO|6|15||or what concord hath the Messiah with Satan? or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever?
2CO|6|16||or what agreement hath the temple of God with that of demons? For ye are the temple of the living God; as it is said, I will dwell among them, and walk among them, and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2CO|6|17||Wherefore, come ye out from among them, and be ye separate from them, saith the Lord; and come not near the unclean thing, and I will receive you;
2CO|6|18||and will be to you a Father, and ye shall be sons and daughters to me, saith the Lord Almighty.
2CO|7|1||Seeing, therefore, we have these promises, my beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit; and let us work righteousness, in the fear of God.
2CO|7|2||Bear with us, my brethren; we have done evil to no one; we have corrupted no one; we have wronged no one.
2CO|7|3||I speak [thus], not to condemn you; for I have said before, that ye are treasured in our hearts, to die and to live together.
2CO|7|4||I have great assurance before you, and have much glorying in you; and I am full of comfort. And joy greatly aboundeth to me, in all my afflictions.
2CO|7|5||For, after we came to Macedonia, there was no rest for our body, but we were distressed in every thing; without was conflict, and within was fear.
2CO|7|6||But God who comforteth the depressed, comforted us by the arrival of Titus.
2CO|7|7||And not merely by his arrival, but also by the refreshing with which he was refreshed by you. For he told us of your love towards us, and of your grief, and of your zeal in our behalf: and when I heard it, my joy was great.
2CO|7|8||And although I made you sad by the epistle, I do not regret it, though I did regret it; for I see that that epistle, though for a time it made you sad,
2CO|7|9||yet it procured me joy, not because ye had sorrow, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance; for ye sorrowed in godly sorrow; so that ye received no detriment from us.
2CO|7|10||For, sorrowing on account of God, worketh a conversion of the soul which is not reversed, and a turning unto life: but the sorrowing of the world worketh death.
2CO|7|11||For behold this same thing, that ye were distressed on account of God, what solicitude it wrought in you, and apologizing and indignation, and fear, and love, and zeal, and revenge? And in all things ye have shown, that ye are [now] pure in that matter.
2CO|7|12||And it will be [seen] that I wrote to you, not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who received the wrong, [only,] but that your solicitude in respect to us might be known before God.
2CO|7|13||Wherefore we were comforted; and with our consolation, we were the more joyful for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all:
2CO|7|14||so that I was not ashamed of that in which I had gloried to him, respecting you; but as in every thing we spoke the truth to you, so also our glorying before Titus, is found to be in truth:
2CO|7|15||and also his bowels are the more enlarged towards you, while he remembereth the submission of you all, and how ye received him with fear and trembling.
2CO|7|16||I rejoice, that in every thing I have full confidence in you.
2CO|8|1||And, my brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which was conferred on the churches of the Macedonians;
2CO|8|2||that in the great trial of their affliction, there was an abounding to their joy, and the depth of their poverty was exuberant in the riches of their liberality.
2CO|8|3||For I testify that, according to their ability, and beyond their ability, in the spontaneity of their mind,
2CO|8|4||they besought us, with much entreaty, that they might participate in the beneficence of the ministration to the saints.
2CO|8|5||And not [only] as we had expected, but they first gave themselves unto the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
2CO|8|6||So that we requested Titus, that as he had begun, so he would perfect in you also the same beneficence.
2CO|8|7||And as ye are enriched in every thing, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in our love towards you, so abound ye in this beneficence also.
2CO|8|8||I do not actually command you, but by the promptitude of your fellow [disciples], I would test the sincerity of your love.
2CO|8|9||For ye know the goodness of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who when he was rich, for your sakes became poor, that by his poverty ye might be made rich.
2CO|8|10||And I urgently recommend to you, that which is for your advantage; inasmuch as ye began, a year ago, not only to purpose, but also to perform.
2CO|8|11||And now complete ye by action, what ye purposed; that as ye had a promptitude in your purposing, so ye may fulfill [it] in action, according to your ability.
2CO|8|12||For if there is a willingness, a person is accepted according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not.
2CO|8|13||For it is not, that others may have easement, and you pressure;
2CO|8|14||but that ye may be on equality at the present time; and that your abundance may be [a supply] to their want; that their abundance likewise may be [a supply] to your want; that there may be equality.
2CO|8|15||As it is written, He who gathered much, had nothing over; and he that gathered little, was not deficient.
2CO|8|16||But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus this solicitude for you.
2CO|8|17||For he received our exhortation; and, because he was very anxious, he cheerfully set out to visit you.
2CO|8|18||And we also sent with him that our brother, whose praise in the gospel is in all the churches;
2CO|8|19||inasmuch as he likewise had been expressly chosen by the churches, to accompany me with this beneficence which is ministered by us to the glory of God and to our cordiality.
2CO|8|20||And we hereby guarded, that no one should cast censure on us, in [respect to] this abundance which is ministered by us.
2CO|8|21||For we are attentive to things commendable, not only before God, but also before men.
2CO|8|22||And we also sent with them that brother of ours, who hath often, and in many things, been proved diligent by us; and is now particularly diligent, from the great confidence [he hath] in you.
2CO|8|23||And therefore, if Titus [be inquired about], he is my associate and assistant among you: or if our other brethren, they are the legates of the churches of the Messiah's glory.
2CO|8|24||Therefore exhibit ye to them, in the presence of all the churches, a demonstration of your love and of our glorying respecting you.
2CO|9|1||And concerning the ministration by the saints, it would be superfluous for me to write to you:
2CO|9|2||for I know the goodness of your mind; and therefore I gloried of you before the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath excited many.
2CO|9|3||Yet I sent the brethren, lest the glorying with which we have gloried in you in regard to this matter, should prove vain; and that ye, as I said, may be ready;
2CO|9|4||so that, if the Macedonians should come with me, and should find you unprepared, wenot to say, yeshould be put to shame for that glorying in which we gloried.
2CO|9|5||Therefore I was careful to request these my brethren, to go before me unto you, that they might make up this benefaction, of which ye were advised long before to have it ready, as being a benefaction, and not a matter of cupidity.
2CO|9|6||And this [I say]: He that soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.
2CO|9|7||Every man, according to his own views, not with sadness, not by constraint: for the Lord loveth a joyous giver.
2CO|9|8||For it is in the power of God, to make all good abound to you, so that ye may have, at all times, and in every thing, what is sufficient for you; and may abound in every good work.
2CO|9|9||As it is written, He hath dispersed and given to the poor; and his righteousness is established for ever.
2CO|9|10||Now he that giveth seed to the sower, and bread for food, may he give and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:
2CO|9|11||so that in every thing, ye may be enriched unto all liberality, to the completion of our thanksgiving to God.
2CO|9|12||For the performance of this ministration, not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is also rich in many thanksgivings to God.
2CO|9|13||For on account of the test of this ministration, we glorify God, that ye do subject yourselves to the profession of the gospel of the Messiah, and that in your liberality, ye communicate with them and with all men:
2CO|9|14||and they put up prayer for you, with much love, because of the abundance of the grace of God that is upon you.
2CO|9|15||Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
2CO|10|1||Now I, Paul, beseech you, by the mildness and gentleness of the Messiah, although I am mild towards you when present, but bold towards you when absent!
2CO|10|2||yet I beseech of you that, when I come, I may not be compelled by the boldness that is in me to be daring, as I estimate it, towards the persons who think we walk according to the flesh.
2CO|10|3||For, although we walk in the flesh, our warfare is not after the flesh.
2CO|10|4||For the arms of our warfare are not those of the flesh, but those of the power of God; by which we subdue rebellious castles.
2CO|10|5||And we demolish imaginations, and every lofty thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and subjugate all reasonings to obedience to the Messiah.
2CO|10|6||And we are prepared, when your obedience shall be complete, to execute judgment on all the disobeying.
2CO|10|7||Do ye look on outward appearances? If any one is confident in himself that he is of the Messiah, let him know, from himself, that as he is of the Messiah, so also are we.
2CO|10|8||For if I should glory somewhat more, in the authority which our Lord hath given me, I should not be ashamed; for he gave it to us for your edification, and not for your destruction.
2CO|10|9||But I forbear, lest I should be thought to terrify you terribly, by my epistles.
2CO|10|10||For there are some who say, [His] epistles are weighty and forcible, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
2CO|10|11||But let him who saith so, consider this, that such as we are in our epistolary discourse, when absent, such also are we in action, when present.
2CO|10|12||For we dare not value, or compare ourselves, with those who vaunt: but they, because they compare themselves with themselves, are not wise.
2CO|10|13||But we will not glory beyond our measure, but within the measure of the limits which God hath imparted to us, that we should reach as far as you.
2CO|10|14||For we do not stretch ourselves, as if not reaching to you; for we do reach as far as you in the annunciation of the Messiah.
2CO|10|15||And we do not glory beyond our measure, in the toil of others: but we have the hope, that when your faith shall mature, we shall be magnified by you, as [being within] our measure;
2CO|10|16||and that we shall so abound also, as to make announcements beyond you. It is not in the measure of others, [and] in things ready prepared, that we will glory.
2CO|10|17||But let him that will glory, glory in the Lord.
2CO|10|18||For not he who praiseth himself, is approved; but he whom the Lord praiseth.
2CO|11|1||I would that ye could bear with me a little, that I might talk foolishly: and indeed, bear ye with me.
2CO|11|2||For I am jealous over you, with a godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to a husband as a chaste virgin, whom I would present to the Messiah.
2CO|11|3||But I fear, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his craftiness, so your minds should be corrupted from simplicity towards the Messiah.
2CO|11|4||For if he that cometh to you, had proclaimed to you another Jesus, whom we have not proclaimed; or if ye had received another Spirit, which ye have not received; or another gospel, which ye have not accepted; ye might well have given assent.
2CO|11|5||For, I suppose, I came not short of those legates who most excel.
2CO|11|6||For, though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in all things we have been manifest among you.
2CO|11|7||Did I indeed commit an offence, by humbling myself that ye might be exalted? and by proclaiming the gospel of God to you gratis?
2CO|11|8||And I robbed other churches, and I took pay [of them] for ministering to you.
2CO|11|9||And when I came among you and was needy, I was burdensome to none of you; for the brethren who came from Macedonia, supplied my wants: and in all things I kept myself, and I will keep myself, from being burdensome to you.
2CO|11|10||As the truth of the Messiah is in me, this glorying shall not be made vain as to me in the regions of Achaia.
2CO|11|11||Why? Because I do not love you? God knoweth.
2CO|11|12||But what I do, that also I will do; that I may cut off occasion, from them who seek occasion: so that in the thing wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2CO|11|13||For they are false legates, crafty workers, and feign themselves to be legates of the Messiah.
2CO|11|14||And in this there is nothing strange. For if Satan feigneth himself an angel of light,
2CO|11|15||it is no great thing if his ministers feign themselves ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2CO|11|16||Again I say, let no one think of me, as being a fool: or if otherwise, receive me as a fool, that I may glory a little.
2CO|11|17||What I am [now] saying, I say not in our Lord, but as in folly, in this matter of glorying.
2CO|11|18||Because many glory after the flesh, I also will glory.
2CO|11|19||For ye hear with indulgence them who lack reason, seeing ye are wise.
2CO|11|20||And ye give ear to him, who putteth you in bondage; and to him, who devoureth you; and to him, who taketh from you; and to him, who exalteth himself over you; and to him, who smiteth you in the face.
2CO|11|21||I speak as if under contempt: I speak as if we were impotent, through deficiency of understanding; that in whatever thing any one is presuming, I also am presuming.
2CO|11|22||If they are Hebrews, so I also: or if they are Israelites, I also. If they are the seed of Abraham, I also.
2CO|11|23||If they are ministers of the Messiah, (in defect of understanding, I say it,) I am superior to them: in toils more than they, in stripes more than they, in bonds more than they, in deaths many times.
2CO|11|24||By the Jews, five times was I scourged, each time with forty stripes save one.
2CO|11|25||Three times was I beaten with rods: at one time I was stoned: three times I was in shipwreck, by day and by night; I have been in the sea, without a ship.
2CO|11|26||In journeyings many, in peril by rivers, in peril by robbers, in peril from my kindred, in peril from Gentiles: I have been in peril in cities; I have been in peril in the desert, in peril in the sea, in peril from false brethren.
2CO|11|27||In toil and weariness, in much watching, in hunger and thirst, in much fasting, in cold and nakedness:
2CO|11|28||besides many other things, and the thronging around me every day, and my anxiety for all the churches.
2CO|11|29||Who becometh weak, and I become not weak? Who is stumbled, and I burn not?
2CO|11|30||If I must glory, I will glory in my infirmities.
2CO|11|31||God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, blessed for ever and ever, he knoweth that I lie not.
2CO|11|32||At Damascus, the commander of the army of Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to seize me.
2CO|11|33||And from a window, in a basket, they let me down from the wall, and I escaped from his hands.
2CO|12|1||Glorying must be, but it is not profitable: so I proceed to visions and revelations of our Lord.
2CO|12|2||I knew a man in the Messiah fourteen years ago, (but whether in a body, or whether out of a body, I know not; God knoweth:) who was caught up to the third [region] of heaven.
2CO|12|3||And I knew this same man; (but whether in a body, or out of a body, I know not; God knoweth;)
2CO|12|4||and he was caught up to Paradise, and heard ineffable words, which it is not permitted a man to utter.
2CO|12|5||Of him I will glory: but of myself I will not glory, except in my infirmities.
2CO|12|6||Yet if I were disposed to glory, I should not be without reason; for I declare the truth. But I refrain, lest any one should think of me, beyond what he seeth in me and heareth from me.
2CO|12|7||And, that I might not be uplifted by the excellency of the revelations, there was imparted to me a thorn in my flesh, the angel of Satan, to buffet me, that I might not be uplifted.
2CO|12|8||Respecting this, I thrice besought my Lord, that it might depart from me.
2CO|12|9||And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my power is perfected in weakness. Gladly, therefore, will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of the Messiah may rest upon me.
2CO|12|10||Therefore I have pleasure in infirmities, in reproach, in afflictions, in persecutions, in distresses, which are for the Messiah's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2CO|12|11||Behold, I have become foolish in my glorying, for ye compelled me. For ye ought to bear witness for me; because I was inferior in nothing to those legates who most excel, although I was nothing.
2CO|12|12||I wrought among you the signs of the legates, with all patience; and in prodigies, and in wonders, and in mighty deeds.
2CO|12|13||For in what fell ye short of the other churches; except in this, that I was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this fault.
2CO|12|14||Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not burden you; for I seek not yours, but you: for children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for their children.
2CO|12|15||And cheerfully will I both pay [my] expenses, and also give myself for your souls; although the more I love you, the less ye love me.
2CO|12|16||But perhaps, though I was not burdensome to you, yet, like a cunning man, I filched from you by craftiness!
2CO|12|17||Was it by the hand of some other person whom I sent to you, that I pilfered from you?
2CO|12|18||I requested Titus, and with him I sent the brethren: did Titus pilfer any thing from you? Did we not walk in one spirit, and in the same steps?
2CO|12|19||Do ye again suppose, that we would apologize to you? Before God, in the Messiah we speak: and all these things, my beloved, [are] for the sake of your edification.
2CO|12|20||For I fear, lest I should come to you and not find you such as I would wish; and lest I also should be found by you, such as ye would not wish; lest [there should be] contention, and envying, and anger, and obstinacy, and slandering, and murmuring, and insolence, and commotion;
2CO|12|21||lest, when I come to you, my God should humble me; and I should mourn over many, who have sinned, and have not repented of the impurity, the whoredom, and the lasciviousness, which they have committed.
2CO|13|1||This is the third time that I have prepare to come to you; that, by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.
2CO|13|2||I have before said to you, and again I say to you beforehand, (as also I said to you a second time, while I was with you; and now also, while absent, I write to those who have sinned and to the others,) that if I come again, I will not spare:
2CO|13|3||because ye demand proof, that it is the Messiah that speaketh by me, who hath not been powerless among you, but powerful among you.
2CO|13|4||For, though he was crucified in weakness, yet he liveth with the power of God. We also are weak with him; yet we are alive with him, by that power of God which is among you.
2CO|13|5||Examine yourselves, whether ye stand in the faith: prove yourselves. Do ye not acknowledge that Jesus the Messiah is in you? And if [he is] not, ye are reprobates.
2CO|13|6||But, I trust, ye will know that we are not reprobates.
2CO|13|7||And I beseech God, that there may be no evil in you, so that the proof of us may appear: and yet, that ye may be doers of good things, though we be as reprobates.
2CO|13|8||For we can do nothing against the truth, but [only] for the truth.
2CO|13|9||And we rejoice, when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, that ye may be perfected.
2CO|13|10||Therefore, while absent, I write these things; lest when I come, I should act with rigor, according to the authority which my Lord hath given me for your edification, and not for your destruction.
2CO|13|11||Finally, my brethren, rejoice, and be perfected, and be comforted: and may harmony and quietness be among you; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.
2CO|13|12||Salute ye one another, with a holy kiss.
2CO|13|13||All the saints salute you.
2CO|13|14||The peace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
GAL|1|1||Paul, a legate, not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus the Messiah, and God his Father, who raised him from the dead;
GAL|1|2||and all the brethren who are with me; unto the churches which are in Galatia.
GAL|1|3||Grace be with you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah;
GAL|1|4||who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this evil world, agreeably to the pleasure of God our Father:
GAL|1|5||to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
GAL|1|6||I admire, how soon ye have turned from the Messiah, who called you by his grace, unto another gospel;
GAL|1|7||which doth not exist, except as there are some who would disquiet you, and are disposed to pervert the gospel of the Messiah.
GAL|1|8||But if we, or an angel from heaven, should announce to you differently from what we have announced to you, let him be accursed.
GAL|1|9||As I have just said, and now I again say it, that if any one announce to you differently from what ye received, let him be accursed.
GAL|1|10||For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I had till now pleased men, I should not have been a servant of the Messiah.
GAL|1|11||But I make known to you, my brethren, that the gospel announced by me, was not from man.
GAL|1|12||For I did not receive it and learn it from man, but [I had it] by revelation from Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|1|13||For ye have heard of my former course of life in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God exceedingly, and destroyed it:
GAL|1|14||and that I went much farther in Judaism than many of my contemporaries who were of my nation, and was peculiarly zealous for the doctrine of my fathers.
GAL|1|15||But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,
GAL|1|16||to reveal his Son by me, that I should proclaim him among the Gentiles; forthwith, I did not open it to flesh and blood;
GAL|1|17||nor did I go to Jerusalem, to them who were legates before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus:
GAL|1|18||and after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Cephas; and I remained with him fifteen days.
GAL|1|19||But others of the legates I saw not, except James, our Lord's brother.
GAL|1|20||In the things which I am writing to you, behold, before God! I lie not.
GAL|1|21||And after that, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
GAL|1|22||And the churches in Judaea which were in the Messiah; did not know me personally:
GAL|1|23||but this only had they heard, that he who before persecuted us, now preacheth that faith which in time preceding he subverted:
GAL|1|24||and they glorified God in me.
GAL|2|1||And again, after fourteen years, I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas; and I took with me Titus.
GAL|2|2||And I went up by revelation: and I explained to them the gospel which I announce among the Gentiles; and I stated it to them who were esteemed prominent, between myself and them: lest I should have run, or might run in vain.
GAL|2|3||Also Titus, who was with me, and was a Gentile, was not compelled to be circumcised.
GAL|2|4||And in regard to the false brethren, who had crept in to spy out the liberty we have in Jesus the Messiah, in order to bring me under subjection;
GAL|2|5||not for the space of an hour, did we throw ourselves into subjection to them; so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
GAL|2|6||And they who were esteemed prominent, (what they were, I care not; for God regardeth not the persons of men,)even these persons added nothing to me.
GAL|2|7||But, otherwise; for they saw, that the gospel of the uncircumcision was intrusted to me, as to Cephas was intrusted that of the circumcision.
GAL|2|8||For he that was operative with Cephas in the legateship of the circumcision, was also operative with me in the legateship of the Gentiles.
GAL|2|9||And James, Cephas, and John, who were accounted pillars, when they perceived the grace that was given to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; that we [should labor] among the Gentiles, and they among the circumcision.
GAL|2|10||Only [they desired] that we would be mindful of the needy; and I was solicitous to do the same.
GAL|2|11||But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I rebuked him to his face; because they were stumbled by him.
GAL|2|12||For before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but when they came, he withdrew himself, and separated; because he was afraid of them of the circumcision.
GAL|2|13||And the rest of the Jews also were with him in this thing; insomuch that even Barnabas was induced to regard persons.
GAL|2|14||And when I saw, that they did not walk correctly, in the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas, before them all: If thou art a Jew, and livest in the Gentile way, and not in the Jewish, why dost thou compel the Gentiles to live in the Jewish way?
GAL|2|15||For if we, who are Jews by nature, and are not sinners of the Gentiles,
GAL|2|16||because we know that a man is not made just by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus the Messiah; even we have believed in Jesus the Messiah, in order to be made just by faith in the Messiah, and not by the works of the law: for, by the deeds of the law, no flesh is made just.
GAL|2|17||And if, while we seek to become just by the Messiah, we are found to be ourselves sinners, is Jesus the Messiah therefore the minister of sin? Far be it!
GAL|2|18||For if I should build up again the things I had demolished, I should show myself to be a transgressor of the precept.
GAL|2|19||For I, by the law, have become dead to the law, that I might live to God; and I am crucified with the Messiah.
GAL|2|20||And henceforth it is no more I who live, but the Messiah liveth in me: and the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
GAL|2|21||I do not spurn the grace of God. For if righteousness is by means of the law, the Messiah died in vain.
GAL|3|1||O ye Galatians, deficient in understanding! Who hath fascinated you? For lo, Jesus the Messiah hath been portrayed as in a picture, crucified before your eyes.
GAL|3|2||This only would I learn from you, Was it by works of the law, that ye received the Spirit? or by the hearing of faith?
GAL|3|3||Are ye so foolish, that having begun in the Spirit, ye now would consummate in the flesh?
GAL|3|4||And have ye borne all these things in vain? And I would, it were in vain!
GAL|3|5||He therefore who giveth the Spirit in you, and who worketh miracles among you, [doth he these things] by the deeds of the law? or by the hearing of faith?
GAL|3|6||In like manner Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
GAL|3|7||Know ye, therefore, that those who are of faith, they are the children of Abraham.
GAL|3|8||For, because God knew beforehand that the Gentiles would be made just by faith, he preannounced it to Abraham; as saith the holy scripture, In thee shall all nations be blessed.
GAL|3|9||Believers, therefore, it is, who are blessed with believing Abraham.
GAL|3|10||For they who are of the deeds of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who shall not do every thing written in this law.
GAL|3|11||And that no one becometh just before God, by the law, is manifest: because it is written, The just by faith, shall live.
GAL|3|12||Now the law is not of faith; but, whoever shall do the things written in it, shall live by them.
GAL|3|13||But the Messiah hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, and hath been a curse for us; (for it is written, Cursed is everyone that is hanged on a tree;)
GAL|3|14||that the blessing of Abraham might be on the Gentiles, through Jesus the Messiah; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
GAL|3|15||My brethren, I speak as among men; a man's covenant which is confirmed, no one setteth aside, or changeth any thing in it.
GAL|3|16||Now to Abraham was the promise made, and to his seed. And it said to him, not, to thy seeds, as being many; but to thy seed, as being one, which is the Messiah.
GAL|3|17||And this I say: That the covenant which was previously confirmed by God in the Messiah, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot set it aside, and nullify the promise.
GAL|3|18||And if the inheritance were by the law, it would not be by promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
GAL|3|19||What then is the law? It was added on account of transgression, until that seed should come, to whom belonged the promise: and the law was given by angels through a mediator.
GAL|3|20||Now a mediator is not of one; but God is one.
GAL|3|21||Is the law then opposed to the promise of God? Far be it. For if a law had been given, which could make alive, certainly, righteousness would have been by the law.
GAL|3|22||But the scripture hath inclosed all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus the Messiah might be given to them that believe.
GAL|3|23||But before the faith came, the law kept us shut up unto the faith that was to be revealed.
GAL|3|24||The law, therefore, was a monitor for us unto the Messiah, that we might become just by faith.
GAL|3|25||But the faith having come, we are not under the monitor.
GAL|3|26||For ye are all the children of God, by faith in Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|3|27||For they who have been baptized into the Messiah, have put on the Messiah.
GAL|3|28||There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free-born, neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|3|29||And if ye are the Messiah's, then are ye the seed of Abraham, and heirs by the promise.
GAL|4|1||But I say, that the heir, so long as he is a child, differeth not from a servant, although he is lord of all;
GAL|4|2||but he is under supervisors and stewards, until the time established by his father.
GAL|4|3||So also we, while we were children, were in subordination under the elements of the world.
GAL|4|4||But when the consummation of the time arrived, God sent forth his Son; and he was from a woman, and was under the law;
GAL|4|5||that he might redeem them that were under the law; and that we might receive the adoption of sons.
GAL|4|6||And, because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, who crieth, Father, our Father.
GAL|4|7||Wherefore, ye are no longer servants, but sons; and if sons, then heirs of God through Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|4|8||For then, when ye knew not God, ye served them who in their nature are not gods.
GAL|4|9||But now, since ye have known God, or rather, have been known by God, ye turn yourselves again to the weak and beggarly elements, and wish again to be under them!
GAL|4|10||Ye observe days and moons, and set times, and years!
GAL|4|11||I am afraid, lest I have labored among you in vain.
GAL|4|12||Be ye like me; because I have been like you. My brethren, I beseech you. Ye have not injured me at all.
GAL|4|13||For ye know, that under the infirmity of my flesh, I at first announced the gospel to you;
GAL|4|14||and the trial in my flesh, ye did not despise nor nauseate: but ye received me as an angel of God, and as Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|4|15||Where then is your blessedness? For I testify of you, that if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me.
GAL|4|16||Have I become an enemy to you, by preaching to you the truth?
GAL|4|17||They are zealous towards you, yet not for good; but they wish to shut you up, that ye may be zealous towards them.
GAL|4|18||And it is a good thing to be zealous at all times in good things; and not merely when I am present with you.
GAL|4|19||[Ye are] my children, of whom I travail in birth again, till the Messiah be formed in you.
GAL|4|20||And I could wish to be now with you, and to change the tone of my voice; because I am astonished at you.
GAL|4|21||Tell me, ye who desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
GAL|4|22||For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman.
GAL|4|23||But he that was by the bondmaid, was born after the flesh; and he that was by the free woman, was by the promise.
GAL|4|24||And these are allegorical of the two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, which bringeth forth for bondage, is Hagar.
GAL|4|25||For Hagar is the mount Sinai in Arabia, and correspondeth with the present Jerusalem, and is serving in bondage, she and her children.
GAL|4|26||But the Jerusalem above, is the free woman, who is the mother of us.
GAL|4|27||For it is written, Be joyful, thou barren, who bearest not: exult and shout, thou who hast not travailed: for more numerous are the children of the desolate than the children of the married woman.
GAL|4|28||Now we, my brethren, like Isaac, are the children of the promise.
GAL|4|29||And as then, he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him [who was born] of the Spirit; so also [is it] now.
GAL|4|30||But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondmaid, and her son; because the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.
GAL|4|31||So then, my brethren, we are not sons of the bondwoman, but sons of the free woman.
GAL|5|1||Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty with which the Messiah hath made us free; and be not subjected again to the yoke of bondage.
GAL|5|2||Behold, I Paul say to you, That if ye become circumcised, the Messiah is of no advantage to you.
GAL|5|3||And again, I testify to every one who becometh circumcised, that he is bound to fulfill the whole law.
GAL|5|4||Ye have renounced the Messiah, ye who seek justification by the law: and ye have apostatized from grace.
GAL|5|5||For we, through the Spirit, which is from faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
GAL|5|6||For, in the Messiah Jesus, circumcision is nothing, neither is uncircumcision, but the faith that is perfected by love.
GAL|5|7||Ye did run well: who hath interrupted you, that ye acquiesce not in the truth?
GAL|5|8||The bias of your mind is not from him who called you.
GAL|5|9||A little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.
GAL|5|10||I confide in you through our Lord, that ye will entertain no other thoughts. And he that disquieteth you, shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.
GAL|5|11||And I, my brethren, if I still preached circumcision, why should I suffer persecution? Hath the offensiveness of the cross ceased?
GAL|5|12||But I would, that they who disquiet you, were actually cut off.
GAL|5|13||And ye, my brethren, have been called into liberty: only let not your liberty be an occasion to the flesh; but, by love, be ye servants to each other.
GAL|5|14||For the whole law is fulfilled in one sentence; in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
GAL|5|15||But if ye bite and devour one another, beware, lest ye be consumed one by another.
GAL|5|16||And I say: Walk ye in the Spirit; and never follow the cravings of the flesh.
GAL|5|17||For the flesh craveth that which is repugnant to the Spirit; and the Spirit craveth that which is repugnant to the flesh: and the two are the opposites of each other, so that ye do not that which ye desire.
GAL|5|18||But if ye are guided by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
GAL|5|19||For the works of the flesh are known, which are whoredom, impurity, lasciviousness,
GAL|5|20||idol-worship, magic, malice, contention, rivalry, wrath, strife, divisions, discords,
GAL|5|21||envy, murder, drunkenness, revelling, and all the like things. And they who perpetrate these things, as I have before told you, and also now tell you, do not inherit the kingdom of God.
GAL|5|22||But the fruits of the Spirit are, love, joy, peace, long suffering, suavity, kindness, fidelity, modesty, patience.
GAL|5|23||Against these there standeth no law.
GAL|5|24||And they who are of the Messiah, have crucified their flesh, with all its passions and its cravings.
GAL|5|25||Let us therefore live in the Spirit; and let us press on after the Spirit.
GAL|5|26||And let us not be vain-glorious, despising one another, and envying one another.
GAL|6|1||My brethren, if one of you should be overtaken in a fault, do ye who are of the Spirit recover him, in a spirit of meekness: and be ye cautious, lest ye also be tempted.
GAL|6|2||And bear ye one another's burdens, that so ye may fulfill the law of the Messiah.
GAL|6|3||For if any one thinketh himself to be something, when he is not, he deceiveth himself.
GAL|6|4||But let a man examine his own conduct; and then his glorying will be within himself, and not in others.
GAL|6|5||For every man must take up his own load.
GAL|6|6||And let him that heareth the word, communicate to him who instructeth him, in all good things.
GAL|6|7||Do not mistake; God is not deceived; for what a man soweth, that also will he reap.
GAL|6|8||He who soweth in the flesh, reapeth from the flesh corruption: and he who soweth in the Spirit, will from the Spirit reap life everlasting.
GAL|6|9||And while we do what is good, let it not be wearisome to us; for the time will come when we shall reap, and it will not be tedious to us.
GAL|6|10||Now, therefore, while we have the opportunity, let us practice good works towards all men, and especially towards them of the household of faith.
GAL|6|11||Behold, this epistle have I written to you with my own hand.
GAL|6|12||They who are disposed to glory in the flesh, they urge you to become circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted on account of the cross of the Messiah.
GAL|6|13||For not even they themselves, who are circumcised, keep the law: but they wish you to become circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
GAL|6|14||But as for me, let me not glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus the Messiah; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I am crucified to the world.
GAL|6|15||For circumcision is nothing; neither is uncircumcision; but a new creation.
GAL|6|16||And they who press forward in this path, peace be on them, and mercy; and on the Israel of God.
GAL|6|17||Henceforth let no one put trouble upon me; for I bear in my body the marks of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
GAL|6|18||My brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, be with your spirit. Amen.
EPH|1|1||Paul, a legate of Jesus the Messiah by the pleasure of God, to them who are at Ephesus, sanctified, and believing in Jesus the Messiah:
EPH|1|2||Peace be with you, and grace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
EPH|1|3||Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who hath blessed us with all blessings of the Spirit in heaven, by the Messiah:
EPH|1|4||according as he had previously chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and without blame before him; and, in love, predestinated us for himself;
EPH|1|5||and adopted us for sons, in Jesus the Messiah, as was agreeable to his pleasure:
EPH|1|6||that the glory of his grace might be glorified, which he poured upon us by his Beloved One;
EPH|1|7||by whom we have redemption, and the forgiveness of sins by his blood, according to the riches of his grace,
EPH|1|8||which hath abounded in us, in all wisdom and all spiritual understanding.
EPH|1|9||And he hath made us know the mystery of his pleasure, which he had before determined in himself to accomplish,
EPH|1|10||in the dispensation of the fullness of times; that all things might again be made new in the Messiah, things in heaven and [things] on earth.
EPH|1|11||And in him we are elected, according as he predestined us and willed, who worketh all things according to the counsel of his pleasure;
EPH|1|12||that we should be they who first hoped in the Messiah, to the honor of his glory.
EPH|1|13||In whom, ye also have heard the word of truth, which is the gospel of your life, and have believed in him; and have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, who was promised,
EPH|1|14||who is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of them that are alive, and for the praise of his glory.
EPH|1|15||Therefore, lo I also, since I heard of your faith in our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and of your love towards all the saints,
EPH|1|16||cease not to give thanks on your account, and to remember you in my prayers;
EPH|1|17||that the God of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, the Father of glory, may give to you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the recognition of him;
EPH|1|18||and that the eyes of your hearts may be enlightened, so that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints;
EPH|1|19||and what is the excellence of the majesty of his power in us who believe; according to the efficiency of the strength of his power,
EPH|1|20||which he put forth in the Messiah, and raised him from the dead, and seated him at his right hand in heaven,
EPH|1|21||high above all principalities, and authorities, and powers, and lordships, and above every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that to come:
EPH|1|22||and he hath subjected all things under his feet; and hath given him who is high over all, to be the head of the church;
EPH|1|23||which is his body, and the fullness of him who filleth all in all:
EPH|2|1||and also you, [he filleth,] who were dead in your sins, and in your offences,
EPH|2|2||in the which ye before walked, according to the worldliness of this world, and according to the pleasure of the prince potentate of the air, that spirit which is active in the children of disobedience:
EPH|2|3||in which deeds we also, formerly, were conversant, in the cravings of our flesh; and we did the pleasure of our flesh, and of our mind, and were altogether the children of wrath, like the rest.
EPH|2|4||But God who is rich in his mercies, because of the great love with which he loved us,
EPH|2|5||when we were dead in our sins, quickened us with the Messiah, and rescued us by his grace;
EPH|2|6||and resuscitated us with him, and seated us with him in heaven, in Jesus the Messiah:
EPH|2|7||that he might show to the coming ages the magnitude of the riches of his grace, and his benignity towards us in Jesus the Messiah.
EPH|2|8||For it is by his grace we are rescued, through faith; and this is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God:
EPH|2|9||not of works, lest any one glory.
EPH|2|10||For we are his creation; who are created in Jesus the Messiah, for good works, which God hath before prepared for us to walk in.
EPH|2|11||Wherefore be mindful, that ye formerly were carnal Gentiles; and ye were called the uncircumcision, by that which is called the circumcision, and which is the work of the hands in the flesh.
EPH|2|12||And ye were, at that time, without the Messiah; and were aliens from the regulations of Israel; and strangers to the covenant of the promise; and were without hope, and without God, in the world.
EPH|2|13||But now, by Jesus the Messiah, ye who before were afar off, have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah.
EPH|2|14||For he is himself our peace, who hath made the two [become] one, and hath demolished the wall which stood in the midst, and the enmity, by his flesh;
EPH|2|15||and by his prescriptions he hath abolished the law of ordinances; that, in himself, he might make the two to be one new man; and he hath made peace,
EPH|2|16||and hath reconciled both with God, in one body, and hath slain the enmity by his cross.
EPH|2|17||And he came, and proclaimed peace to you afar off, and to those near:
EPH|2|18||because, by him there is access for us both, by one Spirit, unto the Father.
EPH|2|19||Wherefore, ye are not strangers, nor sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.
EPH|2|20||And ye are built upon the foundations of the legates and the prophets; and Jesus the Messiah hath become the head of the corner in the edifice.
EPH|2|21||And in him all the edifice is framed together, and groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;
EPH|2|22||while ye also are builded in him, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
EPH|3|1||On this account, I Paul am a prisoner of Jesus the Messiah, for the sake of you Gentiles:
EPH|3|2||if so be, ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which was given to me among you:
EPH|3|3||that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, (as I have [now] written to you in brief,
EPH|3|4||so that while ye read, ye might be able to understand my knowledge of the mystery of the Messiah,)
EPH|3|5||which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy legates and to his prophets, by the Spirit;
EPH|3|6||that the Gentiles should be sharers. of his inheritance, and partakers of his body, and of the promise which is given in him by the gospel;
EPH|3|7||of which I have been a minister, according to the gift of the goodness of God, which was imparted to me by the operation of his power:
EPH|3|8||to me, who am the least of all the saints, hath this grace been given, that I should announce among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Messiah,
EPH|3|9||and should show to all men what is the dispensation of the mystery, which for ages was hid up in God the Creator of all [things]:
EPH|3|10||so that, by means of the church, the manifold wisdom of God might become known to the principalities and powers that are in heaven:
EPH|3|11||which [wisdom] he arranged ages before, and he hath executed it by Jesus the Messiah our Lord;
EPH|3|12||through whom we have boldness and access, in the confidence of his faith.
EPH|3|13||Therefore I pray, that I may not be discouraged by my afflictions, which are for your sakes; for this is your glory.
EPH|3|14||And I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah,
EPH|3|15||from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named;
EPH|3|16||that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit; that in your inner man
EPH|3|17||the Messiah may dwell by faith, and in your hearts by love, while your root and your foundation waxeth strong;
EPH|3|18||and that ye may be able to explore, with all the saints, what is the height and depth, and length and breadth,
EPH|3|19||and may know the greatness of the Messiah's love; and [that] ye may be filled with all the fullness of God.
EPH|3|20||Now to him who is able, by his almighty power, to do for us even more than we ask or think, according to his power that worketh in us;
EPH|3|21||to him be glory, in his church, by Jesus the Messiah, in all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
EPH|4|1||I therefore, a prisoner in our Lord, beseech of you, that ye walk, (as it becometh the calling wherewith ye are called,)
EPH|4|2||with all lowliness of mind, and quietness, and long suffering; and that ye be forbearing one towards another, in love.
EPH|4|3||And be ye solicitous to keep the unity of the Spirit, in a bond of peace;
EPH|4|4||so that ye may become one body, and one Spirit; even as ye are called unto one hope of your calling.
EPH|4|5||For, the Lord is one, and the faith one, and the baptism one;
EPH|4|6||and one God is the Father of all, and over all, and by all, and in us all.
EPH|4|7||And to each of us grace is given, according to the measure of the gift of the Messiah.
EPH|4|8||Wherefore it is said: He ascended on high, and carried captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.
EPH|4|9||Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also previously descended to the interior [regions] of the earth?
EPH|4|10||He who descended, is also the same that ascended up, high above all the heavens, that he might fulfill all things.
EPH|4|11||And he gave some, legates; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers:
EPH|4|12||for perfecting the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of the Messiah;
EPH|4|13||until we all become one and the same, in faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and one complete man according to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Messiah:
EPH|4|14||and that we might not be children, agitated and turned about by every wind of the crafty doctrines of men who plot to seduce by their subtilty:
EPH|4|15||but that we might be established in our love; and that every thing in us might progress in the Messiah, who is the head:
EPH|4|16||and from him [it is], the whole body is framed together and compacted by all the junctures, according to the gift that is imparted by measure to each member, for the growth of the body; that his edifice may be perfected in love.
EPH|4|17||And this I say, and testify in the Lord, that henceforth ye walk not as the other Gentiles, who walk in the vanity of their mind:
EPH|4|18||and they are dark in their understandings, and are alienated from the life of God, because there is not in them knowledge, and because of the blindness of their heart.
EPH|4|19||They have cut off their hope, and have given themselves over to lasciviousness, and to the practice of all uncleanness in their greediness.
EPH|4|20||But ye have not so learned the Messiah;
EPH|4|21||if ye have truly heard him, and by him have learned as the truth is in Jesus.
EPH|4|22||But [ye have learned], that ye should lay aside your former practices, the old man that is corrupted with the lusts of error;
EPH|4|23||and should be renewed in the spirit of your minds;
EPH|4|24||and should put on the new man, that is created by God in righteousness and in the holiness of truth.
EPH|4|25||Wherefore, put away from you lying, and speak ye the truth each with his neighbor; for we are members one of another.
EPH|4|26||Be ye angry, and sin not: and let not the sun go down upon your wrath.
EPH|4|27||And give no place to the Accuser.
EPH|4|28||And let him that stole, steal no more; but let him labor with his hands, and do good acts; that he may have to give to him who needeth.
EPH|4|29||Let no hateful language come from your mouth, but that which is decorous, and useful for edification, that it may convey grace to those who hear.
EPH|4|30||And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed for the day of redemption.
EPH|4|31||Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and clamoring, and reviling, be taken from you, with all malice:
EPH|4|32||and be ye affectionate towards one another, and sympathetic; and forgive ye one another, as God by the Messiah hath forgiven us.
EPH|5|1||Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dear children:
EPH|5|2||and walk in love; as the Messiah also hath loved us, and hath given up himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet odor.
EPH|5|3||But whoredom, and all impurity, and avarice let them not be at all heard of among you, as it becometh the saints;
EPH|5|4||Neither obscenities, nor words of folly, or of division, or of scurrility, which are not useful; but instead of these, thanksgiving.
EPH|5|5||For this know ye, that every man who is a whoremonger, or impure, or avaricious, or a worshipper of idols, hath no inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God.
EPH|5|6||Let no man deceive you with vain words; for it is on account of these things that the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
EPH|5|7||Therefore be ye not like them.
EPH|5|8||For ye were heretofore darkness, but now are ye light in our Lord: therefore, as the children of light, so walk ye.
EPH|5|9||For the fruits of the light are in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.
EPH|5|10||And search out what is pleasing before our Lord:
EPH|5|11||And have no commerce with the works of darkness which are unfruitful, but reprove them.
EPH|5|12||For the things they do in secret, it is nauseous even to mention.
EPH|5|13||For all things are exposed and made manifest by the light: and whatever maketh manifest, is light.
EPH|5|14||Wherefore it is said: Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and the Messiah will illuminate thee.
EPH|5|15||See therefore, that ye walk circumspectly; not like the simple,
EPH|5|16||but like the wise, who purchase their opportunity; because the days are evil.
EPH|5|17||Therefore, be not lacking in understanding; but understand ye what is the pleasure of God.
EPH|5|18||And be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness; but be ye filled with the spirit.
EPH|5|19||And converse with yourselves in psalms and hymns; and with your hearts sing to the Lord, in spiritual songs.
EPH|5|20||And give thanks to God the Father, at all times, for all men, in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
EPH|5|21||And be submissive one to another, in the love of the Messiah.
EPH|5|22||Wives, be ye submissive to your husbands, as to our Lord.
EPH|5|23||Because the husband is the head of the wife, even as the Messiah is the head of the church; and he is the vivifier of the body.
EPH|5|24||And as the church is subject to the Messiah, so also let wives be to their husbands in all things.
EPH|5|25||Husbands, love your wives, even as the Messiah loved his church, and delivered himself up for it;
EPH|5|26||that he might sanctify it, and cleanse it, by the washing of water, and by the word;
EPH|5|27||and might constitute it a glorious church for himself, in which is no stain, and no wrinkle, and nothing like them; but that it might be holy and without blemish.
EPH|5|28||It behooveth men so to love their wives, as [they do] their own bodies. For he that loveth his wife loveth himself.
EPH|5|29||For no one ever hated his own body; but nourisheth it, and provideth for it, even as the Messiah the church.
EPH|5|30||For we are members of his body and of his flesh, and of his bones.
EPH|5|31||For this reason, a man should quit his father and his mother, and adhere to his wife; and the two should be one flesh.
EPH|5|32||This is a great mystery; but I am speaking of the Messiah, and of his church.
EPH|5|33||Nevertheless, let each of you severally so love his wife, even as himself: and let the wife reverence her husband.
EPH|6|1||Children, obey your parents in our Lord; for this is right.
EPH|6|2||And the first commandment with promise, is this: Honor thy father and thy mother;
EPH|6|3||that it may be well with thee, and that thy life may be prolonged on the earth.
EPH|6|4||And parents, anger not your children; but train them up in the discipline and doctrine of our Lord.
EPH|6|5||Servants, be obedient to your masters after the flesh, with fear, and with trepidation, and with simplicity of heart, as unto the Messiah.
EPH|6|6||Not in the sight of the eye, as if ye were pleasing men; but as the servants of the Messiah, who are doing the will of God.
EPH|6|7||And serve them with your whole heart, in love, as if serving our Lord and not men;
EPH|6|8||knowing that whatever good thing a man may do, the same will be recompensed to him by our Lord, whether he be a servant or a free man.
EPH|6|9||Also ye masters, do ye so to your servants. Forgive them a fault; because ye know, that ye have a master in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.
EPH|6|10||Finally, my brethren, be strong in our Lord, and; in the energy of his power:
EPH|6|11||And put ye on; the whole armor of God, so that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Accuser.
EPH|6|12||For our conflict is not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, and with those in authority, and with the possessors of this dark world, and with the evil spirits that are beneath heaven.
EPH|6|13||Therefore put ye on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to meet the evil [one]; and, being in all respects prepared, may stand firm.
EPH|6|14||Stand up therefore, and gird your loins with truth; and put on the breastplate of righteousness;
EPH|6|15||and defend your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
EPH|6|16||And herewith take to you the confidence of faith, by which ye will have power to quench all the fiery darts of the evil [one].
EPH|6|17||And put on the helmet of rescue; and take hold of the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
EPH|6|18||And pray ye, with all prayers and supplications, in spirit, at all times: and in prayer be watchful, at all seasons, praying constantly, and interceding for all the saints:
EPH|6|19||and also for me; that language may be given me, in the opening of my mouth; so that I may boldly proclaim the mystery of the gospel,
EPH|6|20||of which I am a messenger in chains; that I may utter it boldly, as I ought to utter it.
EPH|6|21||And that ye also may know my affairs, and what I am doing, lo, Tychicus, a beloved brother, and a faithful minister in our Lord, will acquaint you;
EPH|6|22||whom I have sent to you for this purpose, that ye might know what is [going on] with me, and that your hearts may be comforted.
EPH|6|23||Peace be with the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
EPH|6|24||Grace be with all them who love our Lord Jesus the Messiah without corruptness. Amen.
PHL|1|1||Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus the Messiah, to all the saints that are in Jesus the Messiah at Philippi, with the elders and deacons.
PHL|1|2||Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|1|3||I thank my God at the constant recollection of you,
PHL|1|4||in all my prayers respecting you; and while I rejoice, I adore;
PHL|1|5||on account of your fellowship in the gospel, from the first day until now.
PHL|1|6||Because I am confident of this, that he who hath begun the good works in you, will accomplish them until the day of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|1|7||For thus it is right for me to think of you all, because ye are permanently in my heart, and because, both in my bonds and in the vindication of the truth of the gospel, ye are my associates in grace.
PHL|1|8||For God is my witness, how I love you in the bowels of Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|1|9||And this I pray for, that your love may still increase and abound, in knowledge, and In all spiritual understanding:
PHL|1|10||so that ye may discern the things that are suitable; and may be pure and without offence, in the day of the Messiah,
PHL|1|11||and be full of the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus the Messiah, to the praise and glory of God.
PHL|1|12||And I would that ye might know, my brethren, that the transaction in regard to me, hath eventuated rather for the furtherance of the gospel;
PHL|1|13||so that my bonds, on account of the Messiah, are matter of notoriety in all the court, and to all others.
PHL|1|14||And many of the brethren in our Lord have become confident, on account of my bonds, and are more bold to speak the word of God without fear.
PHL|1|15||And they herald [it], some from envy and contention; but others with good will, and with love for the Messiah;
PHL|1|16||because they know that I am appointed for the vindication of the gospel.
PHL|1|17||And they who herald the Messiah in contention, do it not sincerely; but they hope to add pressure to my bonds.
PHL|1|18||And in this I have rejoiced, and do rejoice, that in every form, whether in pretence or in truth, the Messiah is heralded.
PHL|1|19||For I know, that these things will be found [conducive] to my life, through your prayers and the gift of the Spirit of Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|1|20||So that I hope and expect, that I shall in nothing be put to shame; but with uncovered face, as at all times, so now, the Messiah will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
PHL|1|21||For my life is, the Messiah; and if I die, it is gain to me.
PHL|1|22||But if I have fruits of my labors in this life of the flesh, I know not what I shall choose.
PHL|1|23||For the two press upon me: I desire to be liberated, that I may be with the Messiah; and this would be very advantageous to me.
PHL|1|24||But also the business in regard to you, urges upon me to remain in the body.
PHL|1|25||And this I confidently know, that I shall continue and remain, for your joy, and for the furtherance of your faith;
PHL|1|26||so that when I come again to you, your glorying, which is in Jesus the Messiah only, will abound through me.
PHL|1|27||Let your conduct be as becometh the gospel of the Messiah; so that if I come I may see you, and if absent I may hear of you, that ye stand fast in one spirit and in one soul, and that ye strive together in the faith of the gospel.
PHL|1|28||And in nothing be ye startled, by those who rise up against us; [which is] an indication of their destruction, and of life for you.
PHL|1|29||And this is given to you by God, that ye not only really believe in the Messiah, but also that ye suffer on his account;
PHL|1|30||and that ye endure conflict, as ye have seen in me, and now hear concerning me.
PHL|2|1||If, therefore, ye have consolation in the Messiah, or if a commingling of hearts in love, or if a fellowship of the Spirit, or if compassions and sympathies;
PHL|2|2||complete ye my joy, by having one apprehension, and one love, and one soul, and one mind.
PHL|2|3||And do nothing in strife, or in vain glory; but, with lowliness of mind, let each esteem his neighbor as better than himself.
PHL|2|4||And let not each be solicitous [only] for himself, but every one also for his neighbor.
PHL|2|5||And think ye so in yourselves, as Jesus the Messiah also thought;
PHL|2|6||who, as he was in the likeness of God, deemed it no trespass to be the coequal of God;
PHL|2|7||yet divested himself, and assumed the likeness of a servant, and was in the likeness of men, and was found in fashion as a man;
PHL|2|8||and he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
PHL|2|9||Wherefore, also, God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is more excellent than all names;
PHL|2|10||that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [beings] in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;
PHL|2|11||and that every tongue should confess that Jesus the Messiah is the Lord, to the glory of God his Father.
PHL|2|12||Therefore, my beloved, as ye have at all times obeyed, not only when I was near to you, but now when I am far from you, prosecute the work of your life, more abundantly, with fear and with trembling.
PHL|2|13||For God is operating in you, both to purpose, and also to perform that which ye desire.
PHL|2|14||Do all things without murmuring, and without altercation;
PHL|2|15||that ye may be perfect and without blemish, as the sincere children of God, who are resident in a perverse and crooked generation; and that ye may appear among them as luminaries in the world;
PHL|2|16||so that ye may be to them in place of life; for my glory in the day of the Messiah, that I may not have run in vain or toiled for naught.
PHL|2|17||And if I should be made a libation upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and exult with you all.
PHL|2|18||And so also do ye rejoice and exult with me.
PHL|2|19||But I hope in our Lord Jesus, that I shall shortly send Timothy unto you, so that I also may have composure, when informed concerning you.
PHL|2|20||For I have no other one here, who, like my self, will sincerely care for your welfare.
PHL|2|21||For they all seek their own, not the [things] of Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|2|22||But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with his father, so he labored with me in the gospel.
PHL|2|23||Him I hope shortly to send to you, when I shall have seen how [things result] with me.
PHL|2|24||And I trust in my Lord, that I shall shortly come myself to you.
PHL|2|25||But now, a circumstance urged me to send to you Epaphroditus, the brother who is an assistant and laborer with me, but is your legate and minister to my wants.
PHL|2|26||For he longed to see you all, and was anxious, because he knew ye had heard, that he was sick.
PHL|2|27||And indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him: nor was it on him only, but also on me, that I might not have trouble upon trouble.
PHL|2|28||Promptly, therefore, have I sent him to you; so that when ye see him, ye may again be joyful, and I may have a little breathing.
PHL|2|29||Receive him then in the Lord, with all joy; and hold in honor those who are such.
PHL|2|30||For, because of the Messiah's work, he came near to death, and little regarded his life, that he might fulfill what you lacked in the ministration to me.
PHL|3|1||Finally, my brethren, rejoice in our Lord. To write these [things] again and again to you, is not irksome to me, because they make you cautious.
PHL|3|2||Beware of dogs; beware of evil doers; beware of the clipped in flesh.
PHL|3|3||For we are the [real] circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and glory in Jesus the Messiah, and place no reliance on the flesh.
PHL|3|4||And yet I might place reliance on the flesh. For, if any one thinketh that his reliance should be on the flesh, I might [do so] more than he.
PHL|3|5||Circumcised when eight days old; of the stock of Israel; of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew, descendant of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
PHL|3|6||as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; and as to the righteousness of the law, I was without fault.
PHL|3|7||But these things, which had been my excellence, I have accounted a detriment, because of the Messiah.
PHL|3|8||And now also I account them all a detriment, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus the Messiah my Lord; for the sake of whom, I have parted with all things, and have accounted [them] as dung, that I might gain the Messiah,
PHL|3|9||and be found in him; since my righteousness is not [now] that from the law, but that which is from faith in the Messiah, that is, the righteousness which is from God;
PHL|3|10||that thereby I might know Jesus, and the efficacy of his resurrection; and might participate in his sufferings, and be assimilated to his death:
PHL|3|11||if so be, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
PHL|3|12||Not as though I had already taken [the prize], or were already complete; but I run [in the race], if so I may take that, for which Jesus the Messiah took me.
PHL|3|13||My brethren, I do not consider myself, as having taken [it]. But one thing I know, that I forget the things behind me, and reach for the things before me;
PHL|3|14||and I run straight for the goal, that I may obtain the [prize] of victory of the call of God from on high, by Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|3|15||Therefore let those who are perfect, have these views; and if ye differently view any thing, God will reveal that also to you.
PHL|3|16||Nevertheless, that we may attain to this, let us proceed on in one path, and with one consent.
PHL|3|17||Be like me, my brethren; and contemplate them, who walk after the pattern ye have seen in us.
PHL|3|18||For there are many who walk otherwise; of whom I have often told you, and I now tell you, with weeping, that they are adversaries of the cross of the Messiah;
PHL|3|19||whose end is destruction; whose god is their belly, and their glory their shame; whose thoughts are on things of the earth.
PHL|3|20||But our concern is with heaven; and from thence we expect our Vivifier, our Lord, Jesus the Messiah;
PHL|3|21||who will change the body of our abasement, that it may have the likeness of the body of his glory, according to his great power, whereby all things are made subject to him.
PHL|4|1||Wherefore, my beloved and dear brethren, my joy and my crown!---so stand ye fast in our Lord, my beloved!
PHL|4|2||I beseech of Euodias and Syntyche, that they be of one mind in our Lord.
PHL|4|3||I also beseech of thee, my true yokefellow, that thou assist those women who toiled with me in the gospel; together with Clement, and with the rest of my helpers, whose names are written in the book of life.
PHL|4|4||Rejoice ye in our Lord, at all times; and again I say, Rejoice.
PHL|4|5||Let your humility be recognized among all men. Our Lord is near.
PHL|4|6||Be anxious for nothing; but at all times, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make known your requests before God.
PHL|4|7||And the peace of God, which surpasseth all knowledge, will keep your hearts and your minds, through Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|4|8||Finally, my brethren, what things are true, and what things are decorous, and what things are right, and what things are pure, and what things are lovely, and what things are commendable, and deeds of praise and approbation, on these be your thoughts.
PHL|4|9||What things ye have learned, and received, and heard, and seen, in me, these do ye: and the God of peace will be with you.
PHL|4|10||And I rejoice greatly in our Lord, that ye have [again] commenced caring for me; even as ye had before cared [for me,] but ye had not the opportunity.
PHL|4|11||Yet I say this, not because I was in want; for I have learned to make that satisfy me, which I have.
PHL|4|12||I know how to be depressed, and I also know how to abound in every thing; and in all things am I exercised, both in fullness and in famine, in abundance and in penury.
PHL|4|13||I find strength for every thing, in the Messiah who strengtheneth me.
PHL|4|14||Yet ye have done well, in that ye communicated to my necessities.
PHL|4|15||And ye know also, Philippians, that in the beginning of the annunciation, when I left Macedonia, not one of the churches communicated with me in respect to receiving and giving, except ye only;
PHL|4|16||that also at Thessalonica, once and again ye sent me relief.
PHL|4|17||Not that I desire a gift; but I wish fruits may multiply unto you.
PHL|4|18||I have [now] received all, and I abound, and am full: and I accepted all that ye sent to me by Epaphroditus, a sweet odor, and an acceptable sacrifice that pleaseth God.
PHL|4|19||And may God supply all your necessity, according to his riches, in the glory of Jesus the Messiah.
PHL|4|20||And to God our Father, be glory and honor, for ever and ever. Amen.
PHL|4|21||Salute all the saints who are in Jesus the Messiah. The brethren who are with me, salute you.
PHL|4|22||All the saints salute you, especially those of Caesar's household.
PHL|4|23||The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, be with you all. Amen.
COL|1|1||Paul, a legate of Jesus the Messiah by the pleasure of God, and Timothy a brother,
COL|1|2||to them who are at Colosse, the brethren, holy and believing in Jesus the Messiah: peace be with you, and grace from God our Father.
COL|1|3||We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, at all times, and pray for you;
COL|1|4||lo, ever since we heard of your faith in Jesus the Messiah, and of your love to all the saints;
COL|1|5||because of the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, of which ye heard before in the word of truth of the gospel;
COL|1|6||which is announced to you, as also to all the world; and which groweth and yieldeth fruits, as it doth also among you from the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in reality:
COL|1|7||as ye learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of the Messiah;
COL|1|8||and who hath made known to us your love in the Spirit.
COL|1|9||Therefore we also, from the day we heard [of it], have not ceased to pray for you; and to ask that ye may be filled with a knowledge of the good pleasure of God, in all wisdom, and in all spiritual understanding;
COL|1|10||that ye may walk as is right, and may please God with all good works, and may yield fruits, and grow in the knowledge of God;
COL|1|11||and may be strengthened with all strength, according to the greatness of his glory, in all patience and long suffering;
COL|1|12||and may, with joy, give thanks to God the Father, who hath fitted us for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in light;
COL|1|13||and hath rescued us from the dominion of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son;
COL|1|14||by whom we have redemption and remission of sins:
COL|1|15||who is the likeness of the invisible God, and the first-born of all creatures:
COL|1|16||and by him was created every thing that is in heaven and on earth, all that is seen and all that is unseen, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or sovereignties; every thing was through him, and was created by him:
COL|1|17||and he was prior to all, and by him every thing exists.
COL|1|18||And he is the head of the body the church; as he is the head and first-born from among the dead, that he might be the first in all things.
COL|1|19||For it pleased [the Father], that in him all fullness should dwell;
COL|1|20||and by him, to reconcile all things to himself; and through him, he hath pacified, with the blood of his cross, both [those] on earth and those in heaven.
COL|1|21||And also to you, who were before alienated and enemies in your minds, because of your evil deeds,
COL|1|22||to you, he hath now given peace, by the body of his flesh, and by his death; that he might establish you in his presence, holy, without blemish, and without offence;
COL|1|23||provided ye continue in your faith, your foundation being firm, and ye be not removed from the hope of the gospel; of which ye have heard, that it is proclaimed in all the creation beneath heaven; of which [gospel] I Paul am a minister.
COL|1|24||And I rejoice in the sufferings which are for your sakes; and, in my flesh, I fill up the deficiency in the afflictions of the Messiah, in behalf of his body, which is the church;
COL|1|25||of which I am a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me among you, that I should fulfill the word of God,
COL|1|26||[namely,] that mystery, which was hidden for ages and generations, but is now revealed to his saints;
COL|1|27||to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which [mystery] is the Messiah; who in you is the hope of our glory;
COL|1|28||whom we proclaim, and teach and make known to every man, in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Jesus the Messiah.
COL|1|29||And for this also, I toil and strive, with the aid of the strength that is imparted to me.
COL|2|1||And I wish you to know, what a struggle I have for you, and for them of Laodicea, and for the others who have not seen my face in the flesh;
COL|2|2||that their hearts may be comforted, and that they, by love, may come to all the riches of assurance, and to the understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father, and of the Messiah,
COL|2|3||in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.
COL|2|4||And this I say, lest any one should mislead you by the persuasiveness of words.
COL|2|5||For though I am separated from you in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit; and I rejoice at beholding your good order, and the stability of your faith in the Messiah.
COL|2|6||As therefore ye have received Jesus the Messiah our Lord, walk ye in him,
COL|2|7||strengthening your roots and building up yourselves in him, and establishing yourselves in the faith which ye have learned, in which may ye abound in thanksgiving.
COL|2|8||Beware, lest any man make you naked by philosophy, and by vain deception, according to the doctrines of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to the Messiah,
COL|2|9||in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Divinity corporeally.
COL|2|10||And in him ye are also complete, because he is the head of all principalities and authorities.
COL|2|11||And in him ye have been circumcised with a circumcision without hands, by casting off the flesh of sins, by a circumcision of the Messiah.
COL|2|12||And ye have been buried with him, by baptism; and by it ye have risen with him; while ye believed in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
COL|2|13||And you, who were dead in your sins, and by the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath vivified with him; and he hath forgiven us all our sins:
COL|2|14||and, by his mandates, he blotted out the handwriting of our debts, which [handwriting] existed against us, and took [it] from the midst, and affixed [it] to his cross.
COL|2|15||And, by yielding up his body, he showed contempt for principalities and authorities; and put them to shame, openly, in his own person.
COL|2|16||Let no one therefore disquiet you about food and drink, or about the distinctions of festivals, and new moons, and sabbaths;
COL|2|17||which were shadows of the things then future; but the body is the Messiah.
COL|2|18||And let no one wish, by abasing the mind, to bring you under bonds, that ye subject yourselves to the worship of angels; while he is prying into that which he hath not seen, and is vainly inflated in his fleshly mind,
COL|2|19||and holdeth not the head, from which the whole body is framed and constructed, with joints and members, and groweth with the growth [given] of God.
COL|2|20||For if ye are dead with the Messiah from the rudiments of the world, why are ye judged as if ye were living in the world?
COL|2|21||But, touch thou not, and taste thou not, and handle thou not:
COL|2|22||for these things perish in the using; and they are the commandments and doctrines of men.
COL|2|23||And they seem to have a kind of wisdom, in a show of humility, and of the fear of God, and of not sparing the body; not in any thing of excellence, but in things subservient to the body.
COL|3|1||If then ye have risen with the Messiah, seek the things on high, where the Messiah sitteth on the right hand of God.
COL|3|2||Think of things on high; not of the things on earth:
COL|3|3||for ye are dead; and your life is hidden with the Messiah, in God.
COL|3|4||And when the Messiah, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.
COL|3|5||Mortify therefore your members that are on the earth; whoredom, impurity, and the passions, and evil concupiscence, and avarice which is idolatry.
COL|3|6||For on account of these [things], the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
COL|3|7||And in these [things] ye also formerly walked, when ye lived in them.
COL|3|8||But now, put away from you all these, wrath, anger, malice, reviling, filthy talking:
COL|3|9||and lie not one to another; but put off the old man, with all his practices;
COL|3|10||and put ye on the new [man], that is renewed in knowledge, after the likeness of his Creator;
COL|3|11||where there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, neither Greek nor barbarian, neither bond nor free; but the Messiah is all, and in all.
COL|3|12||Therefore, holy and beloved, as the elect of God, put ye on compassions, and tenderness, and suavity, and humbleness of mind, and gentleness, and long suffering.
COL|3|13||And be ye indulgent towards one another, and forgiving to one another: and if any one has a complaint against his neighbor, as the Messiah forgave you, so also do ye forgive.
COL|3|14||And with all these, [join] love, which is the girdle of perfection.
COL|3|15||And let the peace of the Messiah direct your hearts; for to that ye have been called, in one body; and be ye thankful to the Messiah.
COL|3|16||And let his word dwell in you richly, in all wisdom. And teach and admonish yourselves, by psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and with grace in your hearts sing ye unto God.
COL|3|17||And whatever ye do in word or act, do it in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and give thanksgiving through him to God the Father.
COL|3|18||Wives, be ye subject to your husbands, as is right in the Messiah.
COL|3|19||Husbands, love ye your wives, and be not bitter towards them.
COL|3|20||Children, obey your parents in every thing; for this is pleasing before our Lord.
COL|3|21||Parents, anger not your children, lest they be discouraged.
COL|3|22||Servants, obey in all things your bodily masters; not in the sight of the eye only, as those who please men, but with a simple heart, and in the fear of the Lord.
COL|3|23||And whatever ye do, do it with your whole soul, as unto our Lord, and not as to men:
COL|3|24||and know ye, that from our Lord ye will receive a recompense as the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord the Messiah.
COL|3|25||But the delinquent will receive a recompense, according to the delinquency; and there is no respect of persons.
COL|4|1||Masters, do equity and justice to your servants; and be conscious that ye also have a master in heaven.
COL|4|2||Persevere in prayer; and be watchful in it, and in giving thanks.
COL|4|3||And pray also for us, that God would open to us a door of speech, for uttering the mystery of the Messiah, for the sake of which I am in bonds;
COL|4|4||that I may unfold it, and utter it, as it behooveth me.
COL|4|5||Walk in wisdom towards them without: and redeem your opportunity.
COL|4|6||And let your speech at all times be with grace; as it were, seasoned with salt: and know ye, how ye ought to give answer to every man.
COL|4|7||And what is [occurrent] with me, will Tychicus make known to you; who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister, and our fellow-servant in the Lord:
COL|4|8||whom I have sent to you for this purpose, that he might know your affairs, and might comfort your hearts;
COL|4|9||together with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is from among you. These will make known to you what is [occurrent] with us.
COL|4|10||Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, saluteth you; also Marcus, an uncle's son to Barnabas, of whom ye have received directions, that if he come to you, ye may kindly receive him:
COL|4|11||also Jesus, who is called Justus. These are of the circumcision, and they only have aided me in the kingdom of God; and they have been a comfort to me.
COL|4|12||Epaphras saluteth you, who is from among you, a servant of the Messiah, always laboring for you in prayer, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the good pleasure of God.
COL|4|13||For I testify for him, that he hath great zeal for you, and for them of Laodicea, and for them of Hierapolis.
COL|4|14||Luke the physician, our beloved, saluteth you; also Demas.
COL|4|15||Salute ye the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
COL|4|16||And when this epistle shall have been read among you, cause it to be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that which is written from Laodicea, do ye read.
COL|4|17||And say to Archippus: Be attentive to the ministry which thou hast received in our Lord, that thou fulfill it.
COL|4|18||This salutation is by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
1TS|1|1||I Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father and in our Lord Jesus the Messiah: Grace be with you, and peace.
1TS|1|2||We give thanks to God at all times, on account of you all, and remember you continually in our prayers:
1TS|1|3||and we call to mind before God the Father the works of your faith, and the toil of your love, and the patience of your hope in our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
1TS|1|4||For we know your election, my brethren, beloved of God.
1TS|1|5||For our preaching among you, was not in words only; but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in genuine persuasion. Ye also know, how we were among you for your sakes.
1TS|1|6||And ye became imitators of us, and of our Lord, in that ye received the word in great affliction, and with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
1TS|1|7||And ye were a pattern for all the believers who are in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1TS|1|8||For from you the word of our Lord sounded forth; [and] not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place, your faith in God is heard of; so that we have no need to say any thing concerning you.
1TS|1|9||For they declare, what an ingress we had to you, and how ye turned from the worship of idols unto God, that ye might worship the living and true God;
1TS|1|10||while ye wait for his Son from heaven, that Jesus whom he raised from the dead, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
1TS|2|1||And ye yourselves, my brethren, know our entrance among you, that it was not in vain:
1TS|2|2||but we first suffered and were treated with indignity, as ye know, at Philippi; and then, in a great agony, with confidence in our God, we addressed to you the gospel of the Messiah.
1TS|2|3||For our exhortation proceeded not from deceit, nor from impurity, nor in guile:
1TS|2|4||but as we had been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who searcheth our hearts.
1TS|2|5||For at no time have we used flattering speech; as ye know; nor a cloak of cupidity, God is witness.
1TS|2|6||Neither have we sought glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have been chargeable as legates of the Messiah.
1TS|2|7||But we were lowly among you; and like a nurse, who fondleth her children,
1TS|2|8||so we also fondled [you], and were desirous to impart to you, not the gospel of God merely, but also our own soul, because ye were dear to us.
1TS|2|9||For ye recollect, brethren, that we labored and toiled, working with our own hands, by night and by day, that we might not be chargeable to any one of you.
1TS|2|10||Ye are witnesses, and God [also], how we preached to you the gospel of God, purely, and uprightly, and were blameless towards all them that believe:
1TS|2|11||as yourselves know, we entreated each one of you, as a father his children, and comforted your hearts:
1TS|2|12||and we charged you, to walk as it becometh God, who hath called you to his kingdom and his glory.
1TS|2|13||Therefore also we give thanks unceasingly to God, that the word of God which ye received from us, ye did not receive as the word of men, but as being truly the word of God, which worketh efficiently in you and in them that believe.
1TS|2|14||For ye, my brethren, became assimilated to the churches of God in Judaea, the persons who are in Jesus the Messiah; in that ye so suffered, even ye from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews,
1TS|2|15||the persons who slew our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and persecuted their own prophets and us; and they please not God, and are made hostile to all men;
1TS|2|16||and they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may have life; to fill up their sins at all times. And wrath cometh on them to the uttermost.
1TS|2|17||But we, my brethren, have been bereaved of you for a short time, (in visible presence, not in our hearts,) and have the more exerted ourselves, to behold your faces, with great affection.
1TS|2|18||And we purposed to come to you, I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered me.
1TS|2|19||For what is our hope, and our joy, and the crown of our glorying; unless it be ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
1TS|2|20||For ye are our glory, and our joy.
1TS|3|1||And, because we could no longer endure it, we were willing to be left alone at Athens,
1TS|3|2||and to send to you Timothy our brother, a servant of God, and our assistant in the announcement of the Messiah; that he might strengthen you, and inquire of you respecting your faith:
1TS|3|3||lest any of you should be disheartened by these afflictions; for ye know, that we are appointed thereto.
1TS|3|4||For also when we were with you, we forewarned you, that we were to be afflicted; as ye know did occur.
1TS|3|5||Therefore also I could not be quiet, until I sent to learn your faith; lest the Tempter should have tempted you, and our labor have been in vain.
1TS|3|6||But now, since Timothy hath come to us from among you, and hath informed us respecting your faith and your love, and that ye have a good remembrance of us at all times, and that ye desire to see us, even as we [to see] you;
1TS|3|7||therefore we are comforted in you, my brethren, amid all our straits and afflictions, on account of your faith.
1TS|3|8||And now, we live, if ye stand fast in our Lord.
1TS|3|9||For what thanks can we render to God in your behalf, for all the joy with which we are joyful on your account;
1TS|3|10||unless it be, that we the more supplicate before God, by night and by day, that we may see your faces, and may perfect what is lacking in your faith?
1TS|3|11||And may God our Father, and our Lord Jesus the Messiah, direct our way unto you;
1TS|3|12||and increase and enlarge your love towards one another, and towards all men, even as we love you;
1TS|3|13||and establish your hearts unblamable in holiness, before God our Father; at the advent of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, with all his saints.
1TS|4|1||Wherefore, my brethren, I entreat you, and beseech you by our Lord Jesus, that, as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk, and to please God, so ye would make progress more and more.
1TS|4|2||For ye know what command we gave you in our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
1TS|4|3||For this is the pleasure of God, your sanctification; and that ye be separated from all whoredom;
1TS|4|4||and that each one of you might know how to possess his vessel, in sanctity and in honor;
1TS|4|5||and not in the concupiscence of lust, like the rest of the Gentiles who know not God:
1TS|4|6||and that ye dare not to transgress and to overreach any one his brother, in this matter; because our Lord is the avenger of all these, as also we have said and testified to you in time past.
1TS|4|7||For God did not call you unto impurity, but to sanctification.
1TS|4|8||He therefore who spurneth, spurneth not man but God, who hath given his Holy Spirit in you.
1TS|4|9||Now concerning love to the brethren, ye need not that I should write to you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
1TS|4|10||Ye likewise do so, to all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but I entreat you, my brethren, to be exuberant:
1TS|4|11||and that ye strive to be quiet, and to attend to your own affairs; and that ye labor with your own hands; as we directed you;
1TS|4|12||and that ye walk becomingly towards those without; and that ye be dependent on no man.
1TS|4|13||And, I wish you to know, my brethren, that ye should not mourn over them who have fallen asleep, like other people who have no hope.
1TS|4|14||For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them who sleep, will God, by Jesus, bring with him.
1TS|4|15||And this we say to you, by the word of our Lord, that we who may survive and be alive, at the coming of our Lord, shall not precede them who have slept.
1TS|4|16||Because our Lord will himself descend from heaven, with the mandate, and with the voice of the chief angel, and with the trump of God; and the dead who are in the Messiah, will first arise;
1TS|4|17||and then, we who survive and are alive shall be caught up together with them to the clouds, to meet our Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with our Lord.
1TS|4|18||Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.
1TS|5|1||But concerning the times and seasons, my brethren, ye need not that I write to you:
1TS|5|2||for ye know assuredly, that the day of our Lord so cometh, as a thief by night.
1TS|5|3||While they will be saying, Peace and quietness, then suddenly destruction will burst upon them, as distress upon a child-bearer, and they will not escape.
1TS|5|4||But ye, my brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
1TS|5|5||For ye are all children of the light, and children of the day; and are not children of the night, and children of darkness.
1TS|5|6||Let us not therefore sleep, like others; but let us be vigilant and considerate.
1TS|5|7||For they who sleep, sleep in the night; and they who are drunken, are drunken in the night.
1TS|5|8||But let us who are children of the day, be wakeful in mind, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and take the helmet of the hope of life.
1TS|5|9||For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to the acquisition of life, by our Lord Jesus the Messiah:
1TS|5|10||who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we might live together with him.
1TS|5|11||Therefore comfort one another, and edify one another, as also ye have done.
1TS|5|12||And we entreat you, my brethren, that ye recognize them who labor among you, and who stand before your faces in our Lord, and instruct you:
1TS|5|13||that they may be esteemed by you with abundant love; and, on account of their work, live ye in harmony with them.
1TS|5|14||And we entreat you, my brethren, that ye admonish the faulty, and encourage the faint-hearted, and bear the burdens of the weak, and be long suffering towards all men.
1TS|5|15||And beware, lest any of you return evil for evil, but always follow good deeds, towards one another, and towards all men.
1TS|5|16||And be joyful always.
1TS|5|17||And pray without ceasing.
1TS|5|18||And in every thing be thankful: For this is the pleasure of God in Jesus the Messiah, concerning you.
1TS|5|19||Quench not the Spirit.
1TS|5|20||Despise not prophesying.
1TS|5|21||Explore every thing, and hold fast the good:
1TS|5|22||and fly from every thing evil.
1TS|5|23||And may the God of peace sanctify you all, perfectly, and keep blameless your whole spirit, and your soul, and your body, till the coming of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
1TS|5|24||Faithful is he that hath called you, who will do it.
1TS|5|25||My brethren, pray for us.
1TS|5|26||Salute all our brethren with a holy kiss.
1TS|5|27||I conjure you by our Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
1TS|5|28||The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah be with you. Amen.
2TS|1|1||PAUL and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians, which is in God our Father and our Lord Jesus the Messiah:
2TS|1|2||Grace be with you, and peace, from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2TS|1|3||We are bound to give thanks to God always, on your account, my brethren, as it is proper; because your faith groweth exceedingly, and, in you all, the love of each for his fellow increaseth.
2TS|1|4||Insomuch that we also boast of you in the churches of God, on account of your faith, and your patience in all the persecution and trials that ye endure;
2TS|1|5||for a demonstration of the righteous judgment of God; that ye may be worthy of his kingdom, on account of which ye suffer.
2TS|1|6||And since it is a righteous thing with God, to recompense trouble to them that trouble you:
2TS|1|7||and you, who are the troubled, he will vivify, with us, at the manifestation of our Lord Jesus the Messiah from heaven, with the host of his angels;
2TS|1|8||when he will execute vengeance, with the burning of fire, on them that know not God, and on them that acknowledge not the gospel of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2TS|1|9||For these will be recompensed with the judgment of eternal destruction, from the presence of our Lord, and from the glory of his power;
2TS|1|10||when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to display his wonders in his faithful ones; for our testimony concerning you, will be believed, in that day.
2TS|1|11||Therefore we pray for you, at all times; that God would make you worthy of your calling, and would fill you with all readiness for good deeds, and with the works of faith by power;
2TS|1|12||so that the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, may be glorified in you, (and) ye also in him; according to the grace of God, and of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2TS|2|1||But we entreat of you, my brethren, in regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and in respect to our being congregated unto him,
2TS|2|2||that ye be not soon agitated in your mind, nor be troubled, neither by word, nor by spirit, nor by letter, as coming from us, that lo, the day of our Lord is at hand.
2TS|2|3||Let no one deceive you in any way; because [that day will not come], unless there previously come a defection, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
2TS|2|4||who is an opposer, and exalteth himself above all that is called God and Worshipful; so that he also sitteth in the temple of God, as a God, and displayeth himself, as if he were God.
2TS|2|5||Do ye not remember, that, when I was with you, I told you these things?
2TS|2|6||And now, ye know what hindereth his being manifested in his time.
2TS|2|7||For the mystery of the evil One already beginneth to be operative: and only, if that which now hindereth shall be taken from the midst;
2TS|2|8||then at length will that evil One be revealed; whom our Lord Jesus will consume by the breath of his mouth, and will bring to naught by the visibility of his advent.
2TS|2|9||For the coming of that [evil One], is the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
2TS|2|10||and with all the deceptiveness of iniquity, in them that perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, by which they might have life.
2TS|2|11||Therefore God will send upon them the operation of deception, that they may believe a lie;
2TS|2|12||and that they all may be condemned, who believe not the truth, but have pleasure in iniquity.
2TS|2|13||But we are bound to give thanks to God always, on your account, my brethren beloved of our Lord, that God hath from the beginning chosen you unto life, through sanctification of the Spirit, and through faith in the truth.
2TS|2|14||For unto these it was, that God called you by our preaching; that ye might be the glory to our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2TS|2|15||Therefore, my brethren, be established, and persevere in the precepts which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our epistle.
2TS|2|16||And may our Lord Jesus the Messiah himself, and God our Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation and a good hope through his grace,
2TS|2|17||comfort your hearts, and establish [you] in every good word, and in every good work.
2TS|3|1||Henceforth, brethren, pray ye for us, that the word of our Lord may, in every place, run and be glorified, as with you;
2TS|3|2||and that we may be delivered from evil and perverse men; for faith is not in all.
2TS|3|3||And faithful is the Lord, who will keep you and rescue you from the evil One.
2TS|3|4||And we have confidence in you, through our Lord, that what we have inculcated on you, ye both have done, and will do.
2TS|3|5||And may our Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to a patient waiting for the Messiah.
2TS|3|6||And we enjoin upon you, my brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, that ye withdraw from every brother who walketh wickedly, and not according to the precepts which ye received from us.
2TS|3|7||For ye know how ye ought to imitate us, who did not walk wickedly among you.
2TS|3|8||Neither did we eat bread gratuitously from any of you; but, with toil and weariness, we labored by night and by day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you.
2TS|3|9||It was not because we have no authority, but that we might give you an example in ourselves, that ye might imitate us.
2TS|3|10||And while we were with you, we also gave you this precept, That every one who would not work, should likewise not eat.
2TS|3|11||For we hear, there are some among you who walk wickedly, and do nothing except vain things.
2TS|3|12||Now such persons, we command and exhort, by our Lord Jesus the Messiah, that in quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2TS|3|13||And my brethren, let it not be wearisome to you, to do what is good.
2TS|3|14||And if any one hearkeneth not to these [my] words in this epistle, separate that man from you, and have no intimacy with him, that he may be ashamed.
2TS|3|15||Yet, hold him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2TS|3|16||And may the Lord of peace give you peace, always, in every thing. Our Lord be with you all.
2TS|3|17||The salutation in the writing of my own hand, I Paul have written it; which is the token in all my epistles, so I write.
2TS|3|18||The grace of Jesus the Messiah be with you all, my brethren. Amen.
1TM|1|1||Paul, a legate of Jesus the Messiah, by the command of God our life-giver, and of the Messiah, Jesus our hope;
1TM|1|2||to Timothy, [my] true son in the faith: grace and mercy and peace, from God our Father, and the Messiah, Jesus our Lord.
1TM|1|3||When I was going into Macedonia, I requested thee to remain at Ephesus, and to charge certain persons not to teach different doctrines;
1TM|1|4||and not to throw themselves into fables and stories about genealogies, of which there is no end, which produce contention rather than edification in the faith of God.
1TM|1|5||Now the end of the command is love, which is from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and from true faith.
1TM|1|6||But from these some have strayed, and have turned aside to vain words;
1TM|1|7||because they wished to be teachers of the law, while they understood not what they speak, nor the thing about which they contend.
1TM|1|8||Now, we know, that the law is a good thing, if a man conduct himself in it, according to the law,
1TM|1|9||he knowing that the law was not established for the righteous, but for the evil, and the rebellious, and the ungodly, and the sinful, and the perverse and for the impure, and for smiters of their fathers and smiters of their mothers, and for murderers,
1TM|1|10||and for whoremongers, and for copulators with males, and for the stealers of free people, and for liars, and for violators of oaths, and for whatever is contrary to sound doctrine,
1TM|1|11||[namely] that of the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I am intrusted.
1TM|1|12||And I thank him who strengthened me, [even] our Lord Jesus the Messiah; who accounted me faithful, and appointed me to his ministry;
1TM|1|13||me [I say], who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a reviler; but I obtained mercy, because I did it while ignorant and without faith.
1TM|1|14||And in me the grace of our Lord abounded, and faith and love, which is in Jesus the Messiah.
1TM|1|15||Faithful is the declaration, and worthy to be received, that Jesus the Messiah came into the world to give life to sinners, of whom I was the primary.
1TM|1|16||But for this cause had he mercy on me, that in me first Jesus the Messiah might display all his long suffering, for an example to them who were to believe on him unto life eternal.
1TM|1|17||And to the king eternal, incorruptible, and invisible, the sole God, be honor and glory for ever and ever! Amen.
1TM|1|18||This injunction I commit to thee, my son Timothy, according to the former predictions concerning thee, that in them thou mightest war this good warfare,
1TM|1|19||in faith and a good conscience; for they who have repudiated this, have become destitute of faith;
1TM|1|20||like Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to be blasphemers.
1TM|2|1||I exhort thee, therefore, first of all, that thou present to God supplication, and prayer, and intercession, and thanksgiving, for all men:
1TM|2|2||for kings and magistrates, that we may dwell in a quiet and tranquil habitation, with all reverence for God, and with purity.
1TM|2|3||For this is good and acceptable before God our life-giver;
1TM|2|4||who would have all men live, and be converted to the knowledge of the truth.
1TM|2|5||For God is one; and the mediator between God and men is one, [namely] the man Jesus the Messiah;
1TM|2|6||who gave himself a ransom for every man; a testimony that arrived in due time,
1TM|2|7||of which I am constituted a herald and legate. I speak the truth, and do not lie, for I am the teacher of the Gentiles in the belief of the truth.
1TM|2|8||I desire therefore, that men may pray in every place, while they lift up their hands with purity, without wrath, and without disputations.
1TM|2|9||So also, that women [appear] in a chaste fashion of dress; and that their adorning be with modesty and chastity; not with curls, or with gold, or with pearls, or with splendid robes;
1TM|2|10||but with good works, as becometh women who profess reverence for God.
1TM|2|11||Let a woman learn in silence, with all submission:
1TM|2|12||for I do not allow a woman to teach, or to be assuming over the man; but let her remain in stillness.
1TM|2|13||For Adam was first formed, and then Eve.
1TM|2|14||And Adam was not seduced, but the woman was seduced and transgressed the command.
1TM|2|15||Yet she shall live by means of her children, if they continue in the faith, and in love, and in sanctity, and in chastity.
1TM|3|1||It is a faithful saying, that if a man desireth the eldership, he desireth a good work.
1TM|3|2||And an elder ought to be such, that no blame can be found in him; and he should be the husband of one wife, with a vigilant mind, and sober and regular [in his habits], and affectionate to strangers, and instructive;
1TM|3|3||and not a transgressor in regard to wine, and whose hand is not swift to strike; but he should be humble, and not contentious, nor a lover of money;
1TM|3|4||and one that guideth well his own house, and holdeth his children in subjection with all purity.
1TM|3|5||For if he knoweth not how to guide his own house well, how can he guide the church of God.
1TM|3|6||Neither let him be of recent discipleship; lest he be uplifted, and fall into the condemnation of Satan.
1TM|3|7||And there ought to be good testimony of him from those without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of Satan.
1TM|3|8||And so also the deacons should be pure, and not speak double, nor incline to much wine, nor love base gains;
1TM|3|9||but should hold the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
1TM|3|10||And let them be first tried, and then let them serve, if they are without blame.
1TM|3|11||So also should the wives be chaste and of vigilant minds; and they should be faithful in all things; and they should not be slanderers.
1TM|3|12||Let the deacons be such as have each one wife and guide well their children and households.
1TM|3|13||For they who serve well [as deacons], procure for themselves a good degree, and much boldness in the faith of Jesus the Messiah.
1TM|3|14||These things I write to thee, while hoping soon to come to thee;
1TM|3|15||but if I should delay, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God. The pillar and the foundation of the truth,
1TM|3|16||and truly great, is this mystery of righteousness, which was revealed in the flesh, and justified in the spirit, and seen by angels, and proclaimed among the Gentiles, and believed on in the world, and received up into glory.
1TM|4|1||But the Spirit saith explicitly, that in the latter times, some will depart from the faith; and will go after deceptive spirits, and after the doctrine of demons.
1TM|4|2||These will seduce, by a false appearance; and will utter a lie, and will be seared in their conscience;
1TM|4|3||and will forbid to marry; and will require abstinence from meats, which God hath created for use and for thankfulness, by them who believe and know the truth.
1TM|4|4||Because whatever is created by God is good; and there is nothing which should be rejected if it be received with thankfulness;
1TM|4|5||for it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
1TM|4|6||If thou shalt inculcate these things on thy brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus the Messiah, being educated in the language of the faith, and in the good doctrine which thou hast been taught.
1TM|4|7||But the silly tales of old women, shun thou; and occupy thyself with righteousness.
1TM|4|8||For, exercising the body is profitable a little while; but righteousness is every way profitable and hath promise of the life of the present time and of that to come.
1TM|4|9||This is a faithful saying, and worthy of reception.
1TM|4|10||For on this account, we toil and suffer reproach; because we trust in the living God, who is the life-giver of all men, especially of the believers.
1TM|4|11||These things teach thou, and inculcate.
1TM|4|12||And let no one despise thy youth; but be thou a pattern for the believers, in speech, and in behavior, and in love, and in faith, and in purity.
1TM|4|13||Until I come, be diligent in reading, and in prayer, and in teaching.
1TM|4|14||Despise not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, and by the laying on of the hand of the eldership.
1TM|4|15||On these things meditate; give thyself wholly to them: that it may be obvious to all that thou makest advances.
1TM|4|16||Be attentive to thyself, and to thy teaching; and persevere in them. For in doing this, thou wilt procure life to thyself and to them who hear thee.
1TM|5|1||Chide not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men, as thy brothers;
1TM|5|2||and the elder women, as mothers; and the younger women, as thy sisters, with all purity.
1TM|5|3||Honor widows, who are truly widows.
1TM|5|4||But if a widow hath children, or grandchildren, let them first learn to show kindness to their own households, and to repay the obligations to their parents; for this is acceptable before God.
1TM|5|5||Now she who is truly a widow, and solitary, her hope is in God; and she persevereth in prayers, and in supplications, by night and by day:
1TM|5|6||But she who followeth pleasure, is dead while she liveth.
1TM|5|7||These things enjoin thou on them, that they may be blameless.
1TM|5|8||But if any one careth not for them who are his own, and especially for them who are of the household of faith, he hath rejected the faith, and is worse than the unbelievers.
1TM|5|9||Therefore elect thou the widow, who is not less than sixty years [old], and who hath been the wife of one man,
1TM|5|10||and hath a reputation for good works; if she have trained up children, if she have entertained strangers, if she have washed the feet of saints, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have walked in every good work.
1TM|5|11||But the younger widows do thou reject; for they wax wanton against the Messiah, and desire to be married:
1TM|5|12||and their condemnation is fixed, because they have cast off their former faith.
1TM|5|13||And they also learn idleness, wandering from house to house; and not only idleness, but also to talk much, and to pursue vanities, and to utter what they ought not.
1TM|5|14||I would therefore, that the younger women marry, and bear children, and regulate their houses; and that they give no occasion to the adversary for reproach.
1TM|5|15||For some have already begun to turn aside after Satan.
1TM|5|16||If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them support them; and let them not be a burden on the church; so that there may be a sufficiency for such as are really widows.
1TM|5|17||Let the elders who conduct themselves well, be esteemed worthy of double honor; especially they who labor in the word and in doctrine.
1TM|5|18||For the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox in threshing; and, The laborer is worthy of his pay.
1TM|5|19||Against an elder, receive not a complaint, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.
1TM|5|20||Those who sin before all rebuke; that the rest of the people may fear.
1TM|5|21||I charge thee, before God, and our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and his elect angels, that thou observe these things; and let not your mind be preoccupied by any thing: and do nothing with a respect for persons.
1TM|5|22||Lay not the hand hastily on any man; and participate not in the sins of others; keep thyself pure.
1TM|5|23||And hereafter drink not water, but drink a little wine; on account of thy stomach, and thy continuing infirmities.
1TM|5|24||There are persons, whose sins are known, and go before them to the place of judgment; and there are some, whom they follow after.
1TM|5|25||So also good deeds are known: and those which are otherwise cannot be hid.
1TM|6|1||Let them who are under the yoke of servitude, hold their masters in all honor; lest the name of God and his doctrine be reproached.
1TM|6|2||And let them who have believing masters, not treat them with disrespect, because they are their brethren; but let them be more obedient, because they are believers and beloved, in whose service they enjoy quietness. These things teach thou, and request of them.
1TM|6|3||But if there be any one, who teacheth a different doctrine, and doth not accede to the salutary words of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and to the doctrine of the fear of God,
1TM|6|4||he is one that exalteth himself, while he knoweth nothing; and he languisheth in the search and inquiry about words, from which come envy, and contention, and railing, and evil surmising,
1TM|6|5||and the disputation of men, whose minds are corrupt and destitute of the truth, and who suppose that gain is godliness. But from these stand thou aloof.
1TM|6|6||But great is our gain, which is the fear of God, with the use of our competence.
1TM|6|7||For we brought nothing into the world; and we know that we can carry nothing out of it.
1TM|6|8||Therefore, food and clothing satisfy us.
1TM|6|9||But they who desire to become rich, fall into temptations, and into snares, and into many lusts which are foolish and hurtful, and which drown men in destruction and perdition:
1TM|6|10||for the love of money is the root of all these evils. And there are some who, coveting it, have erred from the faith, and brought themselves into many sorrows.
1TM|6|11||But thou, O man of God, flee from these things; and follow after righteousness, and rectitude, and faith, and love, and patience, and humility.
1TM|6|12||And contend in the good contest of faith; and lay hold of life eternal, to which thou art called, and [of which] thou hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.
1TM|6|13||I charge thee, before God, who quickeneth all, and [before] Jesus the Messiah who attested a good testimony before Pontius Pilate,
1TM|6|14||that thou keep the injunction, without stain, and without blemish, until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus the Messiah;
1TM|6|15||which God will, in due time make visible; [God] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords;
1TM|6|16||who only is incorruptible, and dwelleth in light to which no one can approach; and whom no man hath seen, or even can see: to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1TM|6|17||Charge the rich of this world, that they be not uplifted in their minds; and that they confide not in riches, in which is no security; but in the living God, who giveth us all things abundantly for our comfort:
1TM|6|18||and that they do good works, and be rich in well-doings; and be ready to give and to communicate:
1TM|6|19||and that they lay up for themselves a good foundation for that which is future; that they may take hold of real life.
1TM|6|20||O Timothy, be careful of that which is committed to thee; and shun vain words, and the oppositions of false science:
1TM|6|21||for they who profess it, have erred from the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
2TM|1|1||PAUL, a legate of Jesus the Messiah by the pleasure of God, according to the promise of life which is in Jesus the Messiah;
2TM|1|2||to Timothy a beloved son; grace, and mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2TM|1|3||I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that I continually remember thee in my prayers, by night and by day:
2TM|1|4||and I desire to see thee, and I call to mind thy tears; that I may be filled with joy,
2TM|1|5||by the recollection which I have, by thy genuine faith, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and also, I am persuaded, in thee.
2TM|1|6||Wherefore I remind thee, that thou excite the gift of God, that is in thee by the imposition of my hands.
2TM|1|7||For God hath not given us a spirit of fear, but of energy, and of love, and of instruction.
2TM|1|8||Therefore be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure evils in connection with the Gospel, through the power of God;
2TM|1|9||who hath vivified us, and called us with a holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his good pleasure, and his grace that was given us in Jesus the Messiah from time before the ages,
2TM|1|10||and is now made known by the appearing of our Vivifier, Jesus the Messiah; who hath abolished death, and hath made manifest life and immortality, by the gospel:
2TM|1|11||of which I am constituted a herald and a legate, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
2TM|1|12||Therefore I suffer these things: and I am not ashamed; for I know in whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is competent to keep for me my deposit against that day.
2TM|1|13||Let the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, abide with thee; with faith and love, in Jesus the Messiah.
2TM|1|14||Keep thou the good deposit, by the Holy Spirit who dwelleth in us.
2TM|1|15||This thou knowest, that all those in Asia have turned from me; and that among them are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
2TM|1|16||May our Lord bestow mercy on the house of Onesiphorus; for, many times, he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of the chains of my imprisonment.
2TM|1|17||But also, when he came to Rome, he sought for me with diligence, and found me.
2TM|1|18||May our Lord grant him, that he may find mercy with our Lord, in that day. And how he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest.
2TM|2|1||Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is by Jesus the Messiah.
2TM|2|2||And the things thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these commit thou to faithful men, who are competent to teach others also.
2TM|2|3||And endure evils, as a good soldier of Jesus the Messiah.
2TM|2|4||No man, on becoming a soldier, entangleth himself with the business of the world; that he may please him who enlisted him.
2TM|2|5||And if one contend [in the games], he is not crowned, unless he contendeth according to the rules.
2TM|2|6||The husbandman who laboreth, ought first to feed on his fruits.
2TM|2|7||Consider what I say. Our Lord give thee wisdom in all things.
2TM|2|8||Be mindful of Jesus the Messiah, that he arose from the dead; who was of the seed of David, according to my gospel,
2TM|2|9||in which I suffer evils unto bonds, as if an evil-doer: but the word of God is not in bonds.
2TM|2|10||Therefore I endure every thing, for the elect's sake; that they also may obtain life, in Jesus the Messiah, with eternal glory.
2TM|2|11||Faithful is the saying, For if we shall have died with him, we shall also live with him;
2TM|2|12||and, if we shall have suffered, we shall also reign with him. But if we shall have rejected him, he will reject us.
2TM|2|13||And if we shall have not believed in him, he abideth in his fidelity; for he cannot reject himself.
2TM|2|14||Of these things admonish thou them . and charge [them,] before our Lord, that they dispute not, with unprofitable words, to the subversion of those who hear them.
2TM|2|15||And study to present thyself before God, perfectly, a laborer who is not ashamed, one who correctly announceth the word of truth.
2TM|2|16||Avoid vain discourses, in which there is no profit; for they very much add to the wickedness of those occupied with them.
2TM|2|17||And their discourse, like an eating cancer, will lay hold upon many. And one of these is Hymeneus, and another Philetus;
2TM|2|18||who have wandered from the truth, while they say, The resurrection of the dead hath passed: and they subvert the faith of some.
2TM|2|19||But the firm foundation of God standeth; and it hath this seal, The Lord knoweth them who are his: and, Let every one who invoketh the name of our Lord, stand aloof from iniquity.
2TM|2|20||But in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold or silver, but also of wood and of pottery; and some of them for honor, and some for dishonor.
2TM|2|21||If therefore any one purge himself from these things, he will be a pure vessel for honor, fit for the use of his Lord, and prepared for every good work.
2TM|2|22||Fly from all the lusts of youth; and follow after righteousness, and faith, and love, and peace, with them that invoke our Lord with a pure heart.
2TM|2|23||Avoid those foolish discussions which afford no instruction; for thou knowest, that they generate contests.
2TM|2|24||And a servant of our Lord ought not to contend, but to be mild towards every one, and instructive, and patient;
2TM|2|25||that with mildness he may enlighten those who dispute against him, if perhaps God may give them repentance, and they may acknowledge the truth,
2TM|2|26||and may recollect themselves, and may escape out of the snare of Satan, at whose pleasure they have been held ensnared.
2TM|3|1||But this know thou, that in the latter days hard times will come:
2TM|3|2||and men will be lovers of themselves, and lovers of money, boasters, proud, censorious, unyielding towards their own people, denyers of grace, wicked,
2TM|3|3||calumniators, addicted to concupiscence, ferocious, haters of the good,
2TM|3|4||treacherous, rash, inflated, attached to pleasure more than to the love of God,
2TM|3|5||having a form of respect for God, but wide from the power of God. Them who are such, repel from thee.
2TM|3|6||For of them are they who creep into this and that house, and captivate the women who are plunged in sins and led away by divers lusts,
2TM|3|7||who are always learning, and can never come to the knowledge of the truth.
2TM|3|8||Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these withstand the truth: men whose mind is corrupted, and [they] reprobates from the faith.
2TM|3|9||But they will not make progress, for their infatuation will be understood by every one, as theirs also was understood.
2TM|3|10||But thou hast followed after my doctrine, and my manner of life, and my aims, and my faith, and my long suffering, and my love, and my patience,
2TM|3|11||and my persecution, and my sufferings. And thou knowest what I endured at Antioch, and at Iconium, and at Lystra; what persecution I endured: and from all these my Lord delivered me.
2TM|3|12||And likewise all, who choose to live in the fear of God, in Jesus the Messiah, will be persecuted.
2TM|3|13||But evil and seducing men will add to their wickedness, while they deceive and are deceived.
2TM|3|14||But continue thou in the things thou hast learned and been assured of; for thou knowest from whom thou learnedst;
2TM|3|15||because from thy childhood, thou wast taught the holy books, which can make thee wise unto life, by faith in Jesus the Messiah.
2TM|3|16||All scripture that was written by the Spirit, is profitable for instruction, and for confutation, and for correction, and for erudition in righteousness;
2TM|3|17||that the man of God may become perfect, and complete for every good work.
2TM|4|1||I charge thee, before God, and our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who is to judge the living and the dead, at the manifestation of his kingdom,
2TM|4|2||Proclaim the word; and persist [in it] with diligence, in time and out of time; admonish, and rebuke, with all patience and instructiveness.
2TM|4|3||For the time will come, when they will not give ear to sound teaching; but, according to their lusts, will multiply to themselves teachers, in the itching of their hearing;
2TM|4|4||and will turn away their ears from the truth, and incline after fables.
2TM|4|5||But be thou vigilant in all things; and endure evils, and do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill thy ministry.
2TM|4|6||But I am soon to be immolated; and the time of my dissolution hath come.
2TM|4|7||I have fought a good combat, I have completed my race, I have preserved my fidelity;
2TM|4|8||and henceforth there is preserved for me a crown of righteousness, with which my Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day; and not me only, but them also who love his manifestation.
2TM|4|9||Exert thyself to come to me quickly.
2TM|4|10||For Demas hath left me; and hath loved this world and gone away to Thessalonica; Crispus to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
2TM|4|11||Luke only is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is suitable for me, for ministration.
2TM|4|12||And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2TM|4|13||And when thou comest, bring the bookcase, which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, but especially the roll of parchments.
2TM|4|14||Alexander the coppersmith showed me many ills: our Lord will reward him according to his doings.
2TM|4|15||And do thou also beware of him; for he is very insolent against our words.
2TM|4|16||At my first defence, no one was with me, but they all forsook me. Let not this be reckoned to them.
2TM|4|17||But my Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fulfilled; and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was rescued from the mouth of the lion.
2TM|4|18||And my Lord will rescue me from every evil work; and will give me life in his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
2TM|4|19||Present a salutation to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.
2TM|4|20||Erastus hath stopped at Corinth; and Trophimus I left sick at the city of Miletus.
2TM|4|21||Exert thyself to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2TM|4|22||Our Lord Jesus the Messiah be with thy spirit. Grace be with thee. Amen.
TIT|1|1||Paul, a servant of God, and a legate of Jesus the Messiah; according to the faith of the elect of God, and the knowledge of the truth which is in the fear of God,
TIT|1|2||concerning the hope of eternal life, which the veracious God promised before the times of the world;
TIT|1|3||and in due time he hath manifested his word, by means of our announcement, which was confided to me by the command of God our Life-giver;
TIT|1|4||to Titus, a real son after the common faith: Grace and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah, our Life-giver.
TIT|1|5||For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou mightest regulate the things deficient, and establish elders in every city, as I directed thee:
TIT|1|6||him who is blameless, who is the husband of one wife, and hath believing children, who are no revellers, nor ungovernable in sensuality.
TIT|1|7||For an elder ought to be blameless, as the steward of God; and not be self-willed, nor irascible, nor excessive in wine, nor with hands swift to strike, nor a lover of base gains.
TIT|1|8||But he should be a lover of strangers, and a lover of good [deeds], and be sober, upright, kind-hearted, and restraining himself from evil passions;
TIT|1|9||and studious of the doctrine of the word of faith, that he may be able by his wholesome teaching both to console, and to rebuke them that are contentious.
TIT|1|10||For many are unsubmissive, and their discourses vain; and they mislead the minds of people, especially such as are of the circumcision.
TIT|1|11||The mouth of these ought to be stopped: they corrupt many families; and they teach what they ought not, for the sake of base gains.
TIT|1|12||One of them, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always mendacious, evil beasts, idle bellies.
TIT|1|13||And this testimony is true. Therefore chide them sharply; that they may be sound in the faith,
TIT|1|14||and may not throw themselves into Jewish fables, and into the precepts of men who hate the truth.
TIT|1|15||For to the pure, every thing is pure; but to them who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but their understanding is defiled, and their conscience.
TIT|1|16||And they profess that they know God, but in their works they deny him; and they are odious, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobates.
TIT|2|1||But speak thou the things that belong to wholesome doctrine.
TIT|2|2||And teach the older men to be watchful in their minds, and to be sober, and to be pure, and to be sound in the faith, and in love and in patience.
TIT|2|3||And so also the elder women, that they be in behavior as becometh the fear of God; and not to be slanderers; and not to be addicted to much wine; and to be inculcators of good things,
TIT|2|4||making the younger women to be modest, to love their husbands and their children,
TIT|2|5||to be chaste and holy, and to take good care of their households, and to be obedient to their husbands; so that no one may reproach the word of God.
TIT|2|6||And likewise exhort young men to be sober.
TIT|2|7||And in every thing show thyself a pattern, as to all good works: and in thy teaching, let thy discourse be healthful,
TIT|2|8||such as is sober and uncorrupt; and let no one despise it: so that he who riseth up against us, may be ashamed, seeing he can say nothing odious against us.
TIT|2|9||Let servants obey their masters in every thing, and strive to please them, and not contradict, nor pilfer;
TIT|2|10||but let them manifest that their fidelity, in all respects, is good: so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Life-giver, in all things.
TIT|2|11||For the all-vivifying grace of God, is revealed to all men;
TIT|2|12||and it teacheth us, to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live in this world in sobriety, and in uprightness, and in the fear of God,
TIT|2|13||looking for the blessed hope, and the manifestation of the glory of the great God, and our Life-giver, Jesus the Messiah;
TIT|2|14||who gave himself for us, that he might recover us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a new people, who are zealous in good works.
TIT|2|15||These things speak thou, and exhort, and inculcate, with all authority; and let no one despise thee.
TIT|3|1||And admonish them to be submissive and obedient to princes and potentates; and that they be ready for every good work;
TIT|3|2||and that they speak ill of no man; that they be not contentious, but mild; and that in every thing they manifest benignity towards all men.
TIT|3|3||For we also were formerly reckless, and disobedient, and erring, and serving divers lusts, and living in malice and envy, and were hateful and also hating one another.
TIT|3|4||But when the kindness and compassion of God our Life-giver was revealed,
TIT|3|5||not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his mercy, he vivified us, by the washing of the new birth, and by the renovation of the Holy Spirit,
TIT|3|6||which he shed on us abundantly, by Jesus the Messiah our Life-giver:
TIT|3|7||that we might be justified by his grace, and become heirs in the hope of eternal life.
TIT|3|8||Faithful is the word: and in these things, I would have thee also establish them; so that they, who have believed in God, may be careful to cultivate good works: these are the things, which are good, and profitable to men.
TIT|3|9||But foolish questions, and stories of genealogies, and the disputes and contests of the scribes, avoid: for there is no profit in them, and they are vain.
TIT|3|10||An heretical man, after thou hast instructed him once and again, avoid:
TIT|3|11||and know thou, that such a man is perverse, and sinful, and self-condemned.
TIT|3|12||When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, strive thou to come to me at Nicopolis; for I have purposed to winter there.
TIT|3|13||As for Zenas the scribe, and Apollos, endeavor to help them well on their way, that they may want nothing.
TIT|3|14||And let our people learn also to perform good works, on occasions of emergency, that they may not be unfruitful.
TIT|3|15||All they that are with me salute thee. Salute all them who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
PHM|1|1||PAUL, a prisoner of Jesus the Messiah, and Timothy a brother;--- to the beloved Philemon, a laborer with us,
PHM|1|2||and to our beloved Apphia, and to Archippus a laborer with us, and to the church in thy house.
PHM|1|3||Grace be with you, and peace from God our father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
PHM|1|4||I thank my God always, and remember thee in my prayers,
PHM|1|5||lo, from the time that I heard of thy faith, and of the love thou hast towards our Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints;
PHM|1|6||that there may be a fellowship of thy faith, yielding fruits in works, and in the knowledge of all the good things ye possess in Jesus the Messiah.
PHM|1|7||For we have great joy and consolation, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thy love.
PHM|1|8||Therefore I might have great freedom in the Messiah, to enjoin upon thee the things that are right.
PHM|1|9||But for love's sake, I earnestly beseech thee---even I, Paul, who am aged, as thou knowest, and now also a prisoner for Jesus the Messiah.
PHM|1|10||I beseech thee for my son, whom I had begotten in my bonds---for Onesimus;
PHM|1|11||from whom formerly thou hadst no profit, but now very profitable will he be both to thee and to me; and whom I have sent to thee.
PHM|1|12||And receive thou him, as one begotten by me.
PHM|1|13||For I was desirous to retain him with me, that he might minister to me in thy stead, in these bonds for the gospel.
PHM|1|14||But I would do nothing without consulting thee; lest thy benefit should be as if by compulsion, and not with thy pleasure.
PHM|1|15||And, perhaps, also, he therefore departed from thee for a season, that thou mightest retain him for ever;
PHM|1|16||henceforth, not as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother dear to me, and much more to thee, both in the flesh and in our Lord?
PHM|1|17||If therefore thou art in fellowship with me, receive him as one of mine.
PHM|1|18||And if he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, place it to my account.
PHM|1|19||I, Paul, have written [it] with my own hand, I will repay:---not to say to thee, that to me thou owest thy ownself.
PHM|1|20||Yes, my brother, let me be refreshed by thee in our Lord: refresh thou my bowels in the Messiah.
PHM|1|21||Being confident that thou wilt hearken to me, I have written to thee: and I know that thou wilt do more than I say.
PHM|1|22||And herewith, prepare also a house for me to lodge in; for I hope that, by your prayers, I shall be given to you.
PHM|1|23||Epaphras, a fellow-captive with me in Jesus the Messiah, saluteth thee;
PHM|1|24||and Mark, and Aristarchus, and Demas, and Luke, my coadjutors.
PHM|1|25||The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah be with your spirit, my brethren.---Amen.
HEB|1|1||In many ways, and many forms, God anciently conversed with our fathers, by the prophets:
HEB|1|2||But in these latter days, he hath conversed with us, by his Son; whom he hath constituted heir of all things, and by whom he made the worlds;
HEB|1|3||who is the splendor of his glory, and the image of himself, and upholdeth all by the energy of his word; and by himself he made a purgation of sins, and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
HEB|1|4||And he is altogether superior to the angels, as he hath also inherited a name which excelleth theirs.
HEB|1|5||For to which of the angels did God ever say, Thou art my SON, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
HEB|1|6||And again, when bringing the first begotten into the world, he said: Let all the angels of God worship him.
HEB|1|7||But of the angels he thus said: Who made his angels a wind, and his ministers a flaming fire.
HEB|1|8||But of the Son he said: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a righteous sceptre is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
HEB|1|9||Thou hast loved rectitude, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness more than thy associates.
HEB|1|10||And again, Thou hast from the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands:
HEB|1|11||they will pass away, but thou endurest; and they all, like a robe, wax old;
HEB|1|12||and like a cloak, thou wilt fold them up. They will be changed; but thou wilt be as thou art, and thy years will not be finished.
HEB|1|13||And to which of the angels did he ever say: Sit thou at my right hand, until I shall place thy enemies a footstool under thy feet?
HEB|1|14||Are they not all spirits of ministration, who are sent to minister on account of them that are to inherit life?
HEB|2|1||Therefore we ought to be exceedingly cautious, in regard to what we have heard, lest we fall away.
HEB|2|2||For if the word uttered by the medium of angels was confirmed, and every one who heard it, and transgressed it, received a just retribution;
HEB|2|3||how shall we escape, if we despise the things which are our life, things which began to be spoken by our Lord, and were confirmed to us by them who heard from him,
HEB|2|4||while God gave testimony concerning them, by signs and wonders, and by various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit, which were given according to his pleasure?
HEB|2|5||For to the angels he hath not subjected the world to come, of which we speak.
HEB|2|6||But as the scripture testifieth, and saith: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou attendest to him?
HEB|2|7||Thou hast depressed him somewhat lower than the angels: glory and honor hast thou put on his head; and thou hast invested him with authority over the work of thy hand.
HEB|2|8||And all things hast thou subjected under his feet. And in this subjecting of all things to him, he omitted nothing, which he did not subject. But now, we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
HEB|2|9||But we see him, who was depressed somewhat lower than the angels, to be this Jesus, because of the passion of his death; and glory and honor are placed on his head; for God himself, in his grace, tasted death for all men.
HEB|2|10||For it became him, by whom are all things, and on account of whom are all things, and [who] bringeth many sons unto his glory, to perfect the prince of their life by suffering.
HEB|2|11||For he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one [nature]. Therefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren;
HEB|2|12||as he saith, I will announce thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly, I will praise thee.
HEB|2|13||And again, I will confide in him. And again, Behold me, and the children whom thou, God, hast given to me.
HEB|2|14||For because the children participated in flesh and blood, he also, in like manner, took part in the same; that, by his death, he might bring to naught him who held the dominion of death, namely Satan;
HEB|2|15||and might release them, who, through fear of death, are all their lives subject to bondage.
HEB|2|16||For he did not assume [a nature] from angels, but he assumed [a nature] from the seed of Abraham.
HEB|2|17||Wherefore it was right, that he should be in all respects like his brethren; that he might be merciful, and a high priest faithful in the things of God, and might make expiation for the sins of the people.
HEB|2|18||For, in that he himself hath suffered, and been tempted, he is able to succor them who are tempted.
HEB|3|1||Wherefore, my holy brethren, who are called with a calling that is from heaven, consider this Legate and High Priest of our profession, Jesus the Messiah:
HEB|3|2||who was faithful to him that made him, as was Moses in all his house.
HEB|3|3||For much greater is the glory of this man, than that of Moses; just as the glory of the builder of a house, is greater than that of the edifice.
HEB|3|4||For every house is built by some man; but he who buildeth all things is God.
HEB|3|5||And Moses, as a servant, was faithful in all the house, for an attestation to those things that were to be spoken by him:
HEB|3|6||but the Messiah as the SON, [is] over his own house; and we are his house, if we retain unto the end assurance, and the triumph of hope in him.
HEB|3|7||Because the Holy Spirit hath said: To-day, if ye will hear his voice,
HEB|3|8||harden not your hearts to anger him, like the provocators, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
HEB|3|9||when your fathers tempted me, and proved, [and] saw my works forty years.
HEB|3|10||Therefore I was disgusted with that generation, and said: This is a people, whose heart wandereth, and they have not known my ways:
HEB|3|11||so that I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
HEB|3|12||Beware, therefore, my brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart that believeth not, and ye depart from the living God.
HEB|3|13||But examine yourselves all the days, during the day which is called to-day; and let none of you be hardened, through the deceitfulness of sin.
HEB|3|14||For we have part with the Messiah, if we persevere in this firm confidence, from the beginning to the end:
HEB|3|15||as it is said, To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, to anger him.
HEB|3|16||But who were they that heard, and angered him? It was not all they, who came out of Egypt under Moses.
HEB|3|17||And with whom was he disgusted forty years, but with those who sinned, and whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
HEB|3|18||and of whom swore he, that they should not enter into his rest, but of those who believed not?
HEB|3|19||So we see that they could not enter, because they believed not.
HEB|4|1||Let us fear, therefore, lest while there is a firm promise of entering into his rest, any among you should be found coming short of entering.
HEB|4|2||For to us also is the announcement, as well as to them: but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not mingled with the faith of those who heard it.
HEB|4|3||But we, who have believed, do enter into rest. But as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, that they shall not enter into my rest: for lo, the works of God existed from the foundation of the world.
HEB|4|4||As he said of the sabbath, God rested on the seventh day from all his works.
HEB|4|5||And here again, he said, They shall not enter into my rest.
HEB|4|6||Therefore, because there was a place, whither one and another might enter; and those earlier persons, to whom the announcement was made, entered not, because they believed not:
HEB|4|7||again he established another day, a long time afterwards; as above written, that David said, Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
HEB|4|8||For if Joshua, the son of Nun, had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterwards of another day.
HEB|4|9||Therefore it is established, that the people of God are to have a sabbath.
HEB|4|10||For he who had entered into his rest, hath also rested from his works, as God did from his.
HEB|4|11||Let us, therefore, strive to enter into that rest; lest we fall short, after the manner of them who believed not.
HEB|4|12||For the word of God is living, and all-efficient, and sharper than a two-edged sword, and entereth even to the severance of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints and the marrow and the bones, and judgeth the thoughts and reasonings of the heart:
HEB|4|13||neither is there any creature, which is concealed from before him; but every thing is naked and manifest before his eyes, to whom we are to give account.
HEB|4|14||Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, Jesus the Messiah, the son of God, who hath ascended to heaven; let us persevere in professing him.
HEB|4|15||For we have not a high priest, who cannot sympathize with our infirmity; but [one] who was tempted in all respects like us, aside from sin.
HEB|4|16||Let us, therefore, approach with assurance to the throne of his grace, that we may obtain mercy, and may find grace for assistance in the time of affliction.
HEB|5|1||For every high priest, who is from among men, is established over the things of God, in behalf of men, that he may present the offering and the sacrifices for sin:
HEB|5|2||and he can humble himself, and sympathize with the ignorant and the erring, because he also is clothed with infirmity.
HEB|5|3||And, therefore, he is obliged as for the people, so also for himself, to present an offering for his sins.
HEB|5|4||And no one taketh this honor on himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron [was].
HEB|5|5||So also the Messiah did not exalt himself to become a High Priest; but He [appointed him] who said to him, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
HEB|5|6||As he said also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, after the likeness of Melchisedec.
HEB|5|7||Likewise, when he was clothed in flesh, he presented supplication and entreaty with intense invocation, and with tears, to him who was able to resuscitate him from death; and he was heard.
HEB|5|8||And though he was a son, yet, from the fear and the sufferings he endured, he learned obedience.
HEB|5|9||And thus he was perfected and became the cause of eternal life to all them who obey him.
HEB|5|10||And he was named of God, the High Priest after the likeness of Melchisedec.
HEB|5|11||Now, concerning this person, Melchisedec, we have much discourse, which we might utter; but it is difficult to explain it, because ye are infirm in your hearing.
HEB|5|12||For ye ought to be teachers, seeing ye have been long in the doctrine. But now ye need to learn again the first lines of the commencement of the oracles of God: and ye have need of milk, and not of strong food.
HEB|5|13||For every one whose food is milk, is unversed in the language of righteousness, because he is a child.
HEB|5|14||But strong food belongeth to the mature who, being investigators, have trained their faculties to discriminate good and evil.
HEB|6|1||Therefore let us leave the commencement of the word of the Messiah, and let us proceed to the completion. Or will ye again lay another foundation for the repentance which is from dead works, and for the faith in God,
HEB|6|2||and for the doctrine of baptism, and for the laying on of a hand, and for the resurrection from the dead, and for the eternal judgment?
HEB|6|3||We will do this, if the Lord permit.
HEB|6|4||But they who have once descended to baptism, and have tasted the gift from heaven, and have received the Holy Spirit,
HEB|6|5||and have tasted the good word of God, and the power of the world to come,
HEB|6|6||cannot again sin, and a second time be renewed to repentance; or a second time crucify and insult the Son of God.
HEB|6|7||For the earth that drinketh the rain which cometh often upon it, and produceth the herb that is of use to those for whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God.
HEB|6|8||But if it should put forth thorns and briers, it would have reprobation, and be not far from a curse, and its end would be a burning.
HEB|6|9||But, in regard to you, my brethren, we are persuaded better things, and things pertaining to life, although we thus speak.
HEB|6|10||For God is not unrighteous, to forget your works, and your charity which ye have shown in his name, in that ye have ministered and do minister to the saints.
HEB|6|11||And we desire, that each one of you may show this same activity, for the completion of your hope, even to the end:
HEB|6|12||and that ye faint not; but that ye be emulators of them who by faith and patience have become heirs of the promise.
HEB|6|13||For when God made the promise to Abraham, because there was none greater than himself by whom he could swear, he swore by himself;
HEB|6|14||and said: Blessing, I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
HEB|6|15||And so he was patient, and obtained the promise.
HEB|6|16||For men swear by one greater than themselves: and in every controversy that occurs among them, the sure termination of it is by an oath.
HEB|6|17||Therefore, God, being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise, that his promising was irreversible, bound it up in an oath;
HEB|6|18||so that, by two things which change not, and in which God cannot lie, we, who have sought refuge in him, might have great consolation, and might hold fast the hope promised to us;
HEB|6|19||which is to us as an anchor, that retaineth our soul, so that it swerveth not; and it entereth into that within the veil,
HEB|6|20||whither Jesus hath previously entered for us, and hath become a priest for ever, after the likeness of Melchisedec.
HEB|7|1||Now this Melchisedec was king of Salem, a priest of the most high God: and he met Abraham, when returning from the slaughter of the kings; and blessed him.
HEB|7|2||And to him Abraham imparted tithes of all that he had with him. Moreover his name is interpreted king of righteousness; and again [he is called] King of Salem, that is King of Peace.
HEB|7|3||Of whom neither his father nor his mother are written in the genealogies; nor the commencement of his days, nor the end of his life; but, after the likeness of the Son of God, his priesthood remaineth for ever.
HEB|7|4||And consider ye, how great he was; to whom the patriarch Abraham gave tithes and first-fruits.
HEB|7|5||For they of the sons of Levi who received the priesthood, had a statute of the law, that they should take tithes from the people; they from their brethren, because they also are of the seed of Abraham.
HEB|7|6||But this man, who is not enrolled in their genealogies, took tithes from Abraham; and blessed him who had received the promise.
HEB|7|7||But it is beyond controversy, that the inferior is blessed by his superior.
HEB|7|8||And here, men who die, receive the tithes; but there he of whom the scripture testifieth that he liveth.
HEB|7|9||And through Abraham, as one may say, even Levi who receiveth tithes, was himself tithed.
HEB|7|10||For he was yet in the loins of his father, when he met Melchisedec.
HEB|7|11||If, therefore, perfection had been by means of the priesthood of the Levites, in which the law was enjoined on the people; why was another priest required, who should stand up after the likeness of Melchisedec? For it should have said, He shall be after t
HEB|7|12||But as there is a change in the priesthood, so also is there a change in the law.
HEB|7|13||For he of whom these things were spoken, was born of another tribe, of which no one ever ministered at the altar.
HEB|7|14||For it is manifest that our Lord arose from Judah, from a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning a priesthood.
HEB|7|15||And moreover this is further manifest, from his saying that another priest will stand up, after the likeness of Melchisedec,
HEB|7|16||who was not according to the law of corporeal injunctions, but according to the energy of an indissoluble life.
HEB|7|17||For he testified of him: Thou art a priest for ever, after the likeness of Melchisedec.
HEB|7|18||And the change which was made in the first statute, was on account of its impotency, and because their was no utility in it.
HEB|7|19||For the law perfected nothing; but in the place of it there came in a hope, which is better than it, and by which we draw near to God.
HEB|7|20||And he confirmed it to us by an oath.
HEB|7|21||For they became priests without an oath; but this man by an oath. As he said to him by David: The Lord hath sworn, and will not lie, Thou art a priest for ever, after the likeness of Melchisedec.
HEB|7|22||By all this, is that a better covenant of which Jesus is the sponsor.
HEB|7|23||And they as priests were numerous, because they were mortal, and were not permitted to continue:
HEB|7|24||but this man, because he standeth up for ever, his priesthood doth not pass away:
HEB|7|25||and he is able to vivify for ever, them who come to God by him; for he always liveth, and sendeth up prayers for them.
HEB|7|26||For, a priest like to him, was also suitable for us; one pure, and without evil and without stain; one separated from sins, and exalted higher than heaven;
HEB|7|27||and who is not obliged, every day, like the [Aaronic] high priest, to first offer sacrifices for his own sins, and then for the people; for this he did once, by offering up himself.
HEB|7|28||For the law constituted feeble men priests; but the word of the oath, which was subsequent to the law [constituted] the Son perfect for ever.
HEB|8|1||Now the sum of the whole is this, we have a High Priest, who is seated on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven:
HEB|8|2||And he is the minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not man.
HEB|8|3||For every high priest is established, to offer oblations and sacrifices; and therefore, it was proper that this one should also have something to offer.
HEB|8|4||And if he were on earth, he would not be a priest; because there are priests [there], who offer oblations agreeably to the law:
HEB|8|5||[namely] they, who minister in the emblem and shadow of the things in heaven: as it was said to Moses, when he was about to build the tabernacle, See, and make every thing according to the pattern which was showed thee in the mount.
HEB|8|6||But now, Jesus the Messiah hath received a ministry which is better than that: as also the covenant, of which he is made the Mediator, is better, and is given with better promises than the former.
HEB|8|7||For, if the first [covenant] had been faultless, there would have been no place for this second [one].
HEB|8|8||For he chideth them and saith: Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will complete with the family of the house of Israel, and with the family of the house of Judah, a new covenant;
HEB|8|9||not like the covenant which I gave to their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, and brought them out of the land of Egypt; [and] because they continued not in my covenant, I also rejected them, saith the Lord.
HEB|8|10||But this is the covenant which I will give to the family of the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my law in their minds, and inscribe it on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
HEB|8|11||And one shall not teach his fellow-citizen, nor his brother, nor say: Know thou the Lord: because they shall all know me, from the youngest of them to the oldest.
HEB|8|12||And I will forgive them their iniquity; and their sins will I remember no more.
HEB|8|13||In that he said a New [Covenant], he made the first old; and that which is old and decaying, is near to dissolution.
HEB|9|1||Now, under the first [covenant], there were ordinances of ministration, and a worldly sanctuary.
HEB|9|2||For in the first tabernacle which was erected, there was the candlestick, and the table and the bread of the presence; and this was called the Sanctuary.
HEB|9|3||But the inner tabernacle, which was within the second veil, was called the Holy of Holies.
HEB|9|4||And there were in it the golden censer and the ark of the covenant, which was all over laid with gold; and in it were the golden urn which contained the manna and the rod of Aaron which sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;
HEB|9|5||and over it were the cherubim of glory, which overshadowed the mercy seat. But there is not time to speak particularly of each of the things which were so arranged.
HEB|9|6||And into the outer tabernacle the priests, at all times, entered, and performed their ministration.
HEB|9|7||But into the interior tabernacle, once a year only, the high priest entered, with the blood which he offered for himself and for the sins of the people.
HEB|9|8||And by this the Holy Spirit indicated, that the way to the holy [places] was not yet manifested, so long as the first tabernacle was standing:
HEB|9|9||and it was a symbol, for that time, during which oblation and sacrifices were offered that could not make perfect the conscience of him who offered them:
HEB|9|10||but [they consisted] only in food and drink, and in the ablutions of divers things; which were carnal ordinances, and were set up until the time of a reformation.
HEB|9|11||But the Messiah who came, was a High Priest of the good things which he wrought: and he entered into the great and perfect tabernacle, which was not made with hands and was not of these created things.
HEB|9|12||And he did not enter with the blood of goats and calves; but with the blood of himself, he entered once into the sanctuary, and obtained eternal redemption.
HEB|9|13||For if the blood of goats and calves, with the ashes of a heifer, was sprinkled upon them that were defiled, and sanctified them as to the purification of their flesh;
HEB|9|14||then how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purge our conscience from dead works, so that we may serve the living God?
HEB|9|15||And for this reason he became the Mediator of the new covenant, that he might by his death be redemption, to them who had transgressed the first covenant; so that they, who are called to the eternal inheritance, might receive the promise.
HEB|9|16||For where there is a testament, it indicateth the death of him who made it.
HEB|9|17||For it is valid, only of a deceased [person]; because it hath no use, so long as the maker of it liveth.
HEB|9|18||Therefore also the first [covenant] was not confirmed without blood.
HEB|9|19||For when the whole ordinance had been propounded by Moses to all the people, according to the law; Moses took the blood of a heifer, and water, with scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled upon the books and upon all the people;
HEB|9|20||and said to them, This is the blood of the covenant which is enjoined by God.
HEB|9|21||With that blood he also sprinkled upon the tabernacle, and upon all the vessels of ministration:
HEB|9|22||because every thing, according to the law, is purified with blood: and without the shedding of blood, there is no remission.
HEB|9|23||For it was necessary that these, the emblems of heavenly things, should be purified, with those things; but the heavenly things themselves, with sacrifices superior to them.
HEB|9|24||For the Messiah entered not into the sanctuary made with hands, which is the emblem of the true [sanctuary]: but he entered into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us.
HEB|9|25||Neither [was it necessary], that he should offer himself many times, as the high priest entered every year into the sanctuary, with blood not his own:
HEB|9|26||otherwise, he must have suffered many times, since the commencement of the world; but now in the end of the world, he hath once offered himself in a self-sacrifice, to abolish sin.
HEB|9|27||And, as it is appointed to men, that they must once die, and after their death is the judgment;
HEB|9|28||so also the Messiah was once offered; and, by himself, he immolated the sins of many: and a second time, without sins, will he appear for the life of them who expect him.
HEB|10|1||For in the law there was a shadow of the good things to come; not the substance of the things themselves. Therefore, although the same sacrifices were every year offered, they could never perfect those who offered them.
HEB|10|2||For, if they had perfected them, they would long ago have desisted from their offerings; because their conscience could no more disquiet them, who were once purified, on account of their sins.
HEB|10|3||But in those sacrifices, they every year recognized their sins.
HEB|10|4||For the blood of bulls and of goats cannot purge away sins.
HEB|10|5||Therefore, when entering the world, he said: In sacrifices and oblations, thou hast not had pleasure; but thou hast clothed me with a body.
HEB|10|6||And holocausts on account of sins, thou hast not asked.
HEB|10|7||Then I said: Behold I come, as it is written of me in the beginning of the books, to do thy pleasure, O God.
HEB|10|8||He first said: Sacrifices and oblations and holocausts for sins, which were offered according to the law, thou desiredst not;
HEB|10|9||and afterwards he said: Behold I come to do thy pleasure, O God: hereby, he abolished the former, that he might establish the latter.
HEB|10|10||For by this his pleasure, we are sanctified; through the offering of the body of Jesus the Messiah a single time.
HEB|10|11||For every high priest who stood and ministered daily, offered again and again the same sacrifices, which never were sufficient to purge away sins.
HEB|10|12||But this [Priest] offered one sacrifice for sins, and for ever sat down at the right hand of God;
HEB|10|13||and thenceforth waited, until his foes should be placed as a footstool under his feet.
HEB|10|14||For by one offering, he hath perfected for ever, them who are sanctified by him.
HEB|10|15||And the Holy Spirit also testifieth to us, by saying:
HEB|10|16||This is the covenant which I will give them after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my law into their minds, and inscribe it on their hearts;
HEB|10|17||and their iniquity and their sins, I will not remember against them.
HEB|10|18||Now, where there is a remission of sins, there is no offering for sin demanded.
HEB|10|19||We have therefore, my brethren, assurance in entering into the sanctuary, by the blood of Jesus, and by a way of life,
HEB|10|20||which he hath now consecrated for us, through the veil, that is his flesh.
HEB|10|21||And we have a high priest over the house of God.
HEB|10|22||Let us, therefore draw near, with a true heart, and with the confidence of faith, being sprinkled as to our hearts, and pure from an evil conscience, and our body being washed with pure water.
HEB|10|23||And let us persevere in the profession of our hope, and not waver; for he is faithful who hath made the promise to us.
HEB|10|24||And let us look on each other, for the excitement of love and good works.
HEB|10|25||And let us not forsake our meetings, as is the custom of some; but entreat ye one another; and the more, as ye see that day draw near.
HEB|10|26||For if a man sin, voluntarily, after he hath received a knowledge of the truth, there is no longer a sacrifice which may be offered for sins:
HEB|10|27||but the fearful judgment impendeth, and the zeal of fire that consumeth the adversaries.
HEB|10|28||For if he, who transgressed the law of Moses, died without mercies, at the mouth of two or three witnesses;
HEB|10|29||how much more, think ye, will he receive capital punishment, who hath trodden upon the Son of God, and hath accounted the blood of his covenant, by which he is sanctified, as the blood of all men, and hath treated the Spirit of grace with contumely?
HEB|10|30||For we know him who hath said, Retribution is mine; and I will repay: and again, The Lord will judge his people.
HEB|10|31||It is very terrible, to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB|10|32||Therefore, recollect ye the former days, those in which ye received baptism, and endured a great conflict of sufferings, with reproach and affliction;
HEB|10|33||and ye were a gazing stock, and also were the associates of persons who endured these things:
HEB|10|34||and ye were grieved for those who were imprisoned; and ye cheerfully endured the plundering of your goods, because ye knew that ye had a possession in heaven, superior and not transitory.
HEB|10|35||Therefore cast not away your assurance which is to have a great reward.
HEB|10|36||For ye have need of patience; that ye may do the pleasure of God, and may receive the promise.
HEB|10|37||Because, yet a little,and it is a very little time,when he that cometh, will come, and will not delay.
HEB|10|38||Now the just by my faith, will live: but if he draw back, my soul will not have pleasure in him.
HEB|10|39||But we are not of that drawing-back, which leadeth to perdition; but of that faith, which maketh us possess our soul.
HEB|11|1||Now faith is the persuasion of the things that are in hope, as if they were in act; and [it is] the manifestness of the things not seen.
HEB|11|2||And for it the ancients are well testified of.
HEB|11|3||For by faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; and that things seen, originated from those that are not seen.
HEB|11|4||By faith, Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than that of Cain; and on account of it, he is testified of that he was righteous, and God bore testimony to his offering; and in consequence thereof, though dead he yet speaketh.
HEB|11|5||By faith, Enoch was translated, and did not taste death; and he was not found, because God had translated him: for, before he translated him, there was testimony of him, that he pleased God.
HEB|11|6||But, without faith, a man cannot please God. For he that draweth near to God, must believe his existence, and that he will recompense those who seek him.
HEB|11|7||By faith Noah, when he was told of things not seen, feared; and he made himself an ark, for the life of his household; whereby he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
HEB|11|8||By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed, and departed to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance: and he departed, while he knew not whither he was going.
HEB|11|9||By faith, he became a resident in the land that was promised him, as in a foreign land; and abode in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.
HEB|11|10||For he looked for the city that hath a foundation, of which the builder and maker is God.
HEB|11|11||By faith, Sarah also, who was barren, acquired energy to receive seed; and, out of the time of her years, she brought forth; because she firmly believed, that he was faithful who had promised her.
HEB|11|12||Therefore, from one man failing through age, numbers were born, like the stars in the heavens, and like the sand on the shore of the sea which is innumerable.
HEB|11|13||All these died in faith, and received not their promise; but they saw it afar off, and rejoiced in it; and they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
HEB|11|14||Now they who say thus, show that they seek a city.
HEB|11|15||But if they had been seeking that city from which they came out, they had opportunity to return again and go to it.
HEB|11|16||But now it is manifest that they longed for a better [city] than that, [namely,] for that which is in heaven. Therefore God did not refuse to be called their God; for he prepared for them the city.
HEB|11|17||By faith Abraham, in his trial, offered up Isaac; and he laid on the altar his only son, whom he had received by promise.
HEB|11|18||For it had been said to him, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
HEB|11|19||And he reasoned with himself, that God was able even to raise [him] from the dead: and therefore, in the similitude [of a resurrection], he was restored to him.
HEB|11|20||By faith in what was to be, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
HEB|11|21||By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed himself on the top of his staff.
HEB|11|22||By faith Joseph, when dying, was mindful of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave direction concerning his bones.
HEB|11|23||By faith the parents of Moses, after he was born, hid him three months; because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not deterred by the command of the king.
HEB|11|24||By faith Moses, when be became a man, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
HEB|11|25||And he chose to be in affliction with the people of God, and not to live luxuriously in sin for a short season:
HEB|11|26||and he esteemed the reproach of the Messiah a greater treasure than the hoarded riches of Egypt; for he looked upon the recompense of reward.
HEB|11|27||By faith, he left Egypt, and was not terrified by the wrath of the king; and he continued to hope, just as if he saw the invisible God.
HEB|11|28||By faith, they kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, that he who destroyed the first-born might not approach them.
HEB|11|29||By faith, they passed the Red Sea, as on dry land; and in it the Egyptians were swallowed up, when they dared to enter it.
HEB|11|30||By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, when they had been encompassed seven days.
HEB|11|31||By faith Rahab, the harlot, perished not with them who believed not, when she received the spies in peace.
HEB|11|32||What more shall I say? For I have little time to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Sampson, and of Jephtha, and of David, and of Samuel, and of the other prophets:
HEB|11|33||who, by faith, subdued kingdoms, and wrought righteousness, and received promises, and shut the mouths of lions,
HEB|11|34||and quenched the force of fire, and were rescued from the edge of the sword, and were healed of diseases, and became strong in battle, and routed the camps of enemies,
HEB|11|35||and restored to women their children, by a resurrection from the dead. And some died under tortures, and did not hope to escape, that there might be for them a better resurrection;
HEB|11|36||and others endured mockings and, scourgings; others were delivered up to bonds and prisons;
HEB|11|37||others were stoned; others were sawed; others died by the edge of the sword; others roamed about clothed in sheep skins and goat skins, and were needy, and afflicted, and agitated;
HEB|11|38||persons of whom the world was not worthy, and yet they were as wanderers in the desert, and in mountains, and in caves, and in caverns of the earth.
HEB|11|39||And all these, of whose faith there is testimony, received not the promise:
HEB|11|40||because God had provided the aid for us; so that without us they should not be perfected.
HEB|12|1||Therefore let us also, who have all these witnesses surrounding us like clouds, cast from us all encumbrances, and sin, which is always prepared for us; and let us run with patience the race that is appointed for us.
HEB|12|2||And let us look on Jesus, who hath become the commencement and the completion of our faith; who, on account of the joy there was for him, endured the cross, and surrendered himself to opprobrium; and is seated on the right hand of the throne of God.
HEB|12|3||Behold, therefore, how much he suffered from sinners, from them who are adversaries of their own soul, that ye may not be discouraged, nor your soul become remiss.
HEB|12|4||Ye have not yet come unto blood, in the contest against sin.
HEB|12|5||And ye have forgotten the monition, which saith to you, as to children, My son, disregard not the chastening of the Lord; nor let thy soul faint, when thou art rebuked by him.
HEB|12|6||For, whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth; and he scourgeth those sons, for whom he hath kind regards.
HEB|12|7||Therefore endure ye the chastisement; because God is dealing with you as with sons. For what son is there, whom his father chasteneth not?
HEB|12|8||But if ye are without that chastisement, with which every one is chastened, ye are become strangers and not sons.
HEB|12|9||And if our fathers of the flesh chastened us, and we revered them, how much more ought we to be submissive to our spiritual fathers, and live?
HEB|12|10||For they chastened us for a short time, according to their pleasure; but God, for our advantage, that we may become partakers of his holiness.
HEB|12|11||Now all chastisement, in the time of it, is not accounted a matter of joy, but of grief: yet, afterwards, it yieldeth the fruits of peace and righteousness to them who are exercised by it.
HEB|12|12||Wherefore, strengthen ye your relaxed hands, and your tottering knees:
HEB|12|13||and make straight paths for your feet, that the limb which is lame may not be wrenched, but may be healed.
HEB|12|14||Follow after peace with every man; and after holiness, without which a man will not see our Lord.
HEB|12|15||And be careful, lest any be found among you destitute of the grace of God; or lest some root of bitterness shoot forth germs, and trouble you; and thereby many be defiled:
HEB|12|16||or lest any one be found among you a fornicator; or a heedless one like Esau, who for one mess of food, sold his primogeniture.
HEB|12|17||For ye know that, afterwards when he wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found not a place for repentance, although he sought it with tears.
HEB|12|18||For ye have not come to the fire that burned, and the tangible [mount]; nor to the darkness and obscurity and tempest;
HEB|12|19||nor to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words, which they who heard, entreated that it might no more be spoken to them;
HEB|12|20||for they could not endure what was commanded. And even a beast, if it approached the mountain, was to be stoned.
HEB|12|21||And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I fear and tremble.
HEB|12|22||But ye have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the Jerusalem that is in heaven; and to the assemblies of myriads of angels;
HEB|12|23||and to the church of the first-born, who are enrolled in heaven and to God the judge of all; and to the spirits of the just, who are perfected;
HEB|12|24||and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant; and to the sprinkling, of his blood, which speaketh better than that of Abel.
HEB|12|25||Beware, therefore, lest ye refuse [to hear] him who speaketh with you. For if they escaped not, who refused [to hear] him who spake with them on the earth, how much more shall we not, if we refuse [to hear] him who speaketh with us from heaven?
HEB|12|26||Whose voice [then] shook the earth; but now he hath promised, and said, yet again once more, I will shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
HEB|12|27||And this his expression, Once more, indicateth the mutation of the things that are shaken, because they are fabricated; that the things which will not be shaken, may remain.
HEB|12|28||Since, therefore, we have received a kingdom that is unshaken, let us grasp the grace whereby we may serve and please God, with reverence and fear.
HEB|12|29||For our God is a consuming fire.
HEB|13|1||Let love for the brethren dwell among you.
HEB|13|2||And forget not kindness to strangers; for thereby some have been privileged to entertain angels, unawares.
HEB|13|3||And remember those in bonds, as if ye were bound with them: and recollect those in affliction, as being yourselves clothed in flesh.
HEB|13|4||Marriage is honorable in all; and their bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge.
HEB|13|5||Let not your mind love money; but let what ye have, satisfy you. For the Lord himself hath said, I will never leave thee, nor slacken the hand towards thee.
HEB|13|6||And it belongeth to us, to say confidently, My Lord is my aider, I will not fear. What can man do to me?
HEB|13|7||Remember your guides, who have spoken to you godly discourse; examine the issue of their course, and imitate their faith.
HEB|13|8||Jesus the Messiah is the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
HEB|13|9||Be not led away by strange and variable doctrines. For it is a good thing, that we strengthen our hearts with grace, and not with meats; for those have not been benefited, who walked in them.
HEB|13|10||And we have an altar, of which they who minister in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
HEB|13|11||For the flesh of those animals, whose blood the high priest brought into the sanctuary for sins, was burned without the camp.
HEB|13|12||For this reason, Jesus also, that he might sanctify his people with his blood, suffered without the city.
HEB|13|13||Therefore, let us also go forth to him, without the camp, clothed with his reproach:
HEB|13|14||(for we have here no abiding city; but we expect one that is future:)
HEB|13|15||and through him, let us at all times offer to God the sacrifices of praise, that is, the fruits of lips which give thanks to his name.
HEB|13|16||And forget not commiseration and communication with the poor; for with such sacrifices a man pleaseth God.
HEB|13|17||Confide in your guides, and hearken to them; for they watch for your souls, as men who must give an account of you, that they may do this with joy and not with anguish; for that would not be profitable to you.
HEB|13|18||Pray ye for us; for we trust we have a good consciousness, that in all things we desire to conduct ourselves well.
HEB|13|19||Especially do I request you to do this, that I may return to you speedily.
HEB|13|20||May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the flock, by the blood of the everlasting covenant, namely Jesus the Messiah, our Lord,
HEB|13|21||make you perfect in every good work, that ye may do his pleasure; and himself operate in you that which is pleasing In his sight, through Jesus the Messiah; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
HEB|13|22||And I beseech you, my brethren, that ye be patient under this word of exhortation; for it is in few words I have written to you.
HEB|13|23||And know ye, that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: and if he come soon, I, with him, shall see you.
HEB|13|24||Salute all your guides, and all the saints. All they of Italy salute you.
HEB|13|25||Grace be with you all. Amen.
JAM|1|1||James, a servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus the Messiah; to the twelve tribes dispersed among the Gentiles; greeting [peace].
JAM|1|2||Let it be all joy to you, my brethren, when ye enter into many and various trials.
JAM|1|3||For ye know, that the trial of [your] faith, maketh you possess patience.
JAM|1|4||And let patience have its perfect work, so that ye may be complete and perfect, and may lack nothing.
JAM|1|5||And if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask [it] of God, who giveth to all freely, and reproacheth not; and it will be given him.
JAM|1|6||But let him ask in faith, not hesitating: he who hesitateth is like the waves of the sea, which the wind agitateth.
JAM|1|7||And let not that man expect to receive any thing of the Lord,
JAM|1|8||who is hesitating in his mind, and unstable in all his ways.
JAM|1|9||And let the depressed brother rejoice, in his elevation;
JAM|1|10||and the rich, in his depression; because, like the flower of an herb, so he passeth away.
JAM|1|11||For the sun riseth in its heat, and drieth up the herb; and its flower falleth, and the beauty of its appearance perisheth: so also the rich man withereth in his ways.
JAM|1|12||Blessed is the man who endureth temptations; so that when he is proved he may receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.
JAM|1|13||Let no one when he is tempted, say, I am tempted of God: for God is not tempted with evils, nor doth he tempt any man.
JAM|1|14||But every man is tempted by his own lust; and he lusteth, and is drawn away.
JAM|1|15||And this [his] lust conceiveth, and bringeth forth sin; and sin, when mature, bringeth forth death.
JAM|1|16||Do not err, my beloved brethren.
JAM|1|17||Every good and perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no mutation, not even the shadow of change.
JAM|1|18||He saw fit, and begat us by the word of truth; that we might be the first-fruits of his creatures.
JAM|1|19||And be ye, my beloved brethren, every one of you, swift to hear, and slow to speak; and slow to wrath:
JAM|1|20||for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
JAM|1|21||Wherefore, remove far from you all impurity, and the abundance of wickedness; and, with meekness, receive the word that is implanted in our nature, which is able to vivify these your souls.
JAM|1|22||But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only; and do not deceive yourselves.
JAM|1|23||For if any man shall be a hearer of the word, and not a doer of it, he will be like one who seeth his face in a mirror:
JAM|1|24||for he seeth himself, and passeth on, and forgetteth what a man he was.
JAM|1|25||But every one that looketh upon the perfect law of liberty and abideth in it, is not a hearer of something to be forgotten, but a doer of the things; and he will be blessed in his work.
JAM|1|26||And if any one thinketh that he worshippeth God, and doth not restrain his tongue, but his heart deceiveth him; his worship is vain.
JAM|1|27||For the worship that is pure and holy before God the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and that one keep himself unspotted from the world.
JAM|2|1||My brethren, hold ye not the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, with a respect to persons.
JAM|2|2||For if there come into your assembly a man with rings of gold or splendid garments, and there come in a poor man in sordid garments;
JAM|2|3||and ye show respect to him who is clothed in splendid garments, and say to him, Seat thyself here, conspicuously; while to the poor man, ye say, Stand thou there, or sit thou here before my footstool;
JAM|2|4||are ye not divided among yourselves, and become expositors of evil thoughts?
JAM|2|5||Hear, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of the world, but the rich in faith, to be heirs in the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?
JAM|2|6||But ye have despised the poor man. Do not rich men exalt themselves over you, and drag you before the tribunals?
JAM|2|7||Do they not revile that worthy name, which is invoked upon you?
JAM|2|8||And if in this ye fulfill the law of God, as it is written, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye will do well:
JAM|2|9||but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin; and ye are convicted by the law, as transgressors of the law.
JAM|2|10||For he that shall keep the whole law, and yet fail in one [precept], is obnoxious to the whole law.
JAM|2|11||For he who said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. If then thou commit no adultery, but thou killest, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.
JAM|2|12||So speak ye, and so act, as persons that are to be judged by the law of liberty.
JAM|2|13||For judgment without mercy shall be on him, who hath practised no mercy: by mercy, ye will be raised above judgment.
JAM|2|14||What is the use, my brethren, if a man say, I have faith; and he hath no works? can his faith vivify him?
JAM|2|15||Or if a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
JAM|2|16||and one of you say to them, Go in peace, warm yourselves, and be full; and ye give them not the necessaries of the body, what is the use?
JAM|2|17||So also faith alone, without works, is dead.
JAM|2|18||For a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show to me thy faith that is without works; and I will show to thee, my faith by my works.
JAM|2|19||Thou believest that there is one God; thou dost well; the demons also believe, and tremble.
JAM|2|20||Wouldst thou know, O frail man, that faith without works is dead?
JAM|2|21||Abraham our father, was not he justified by works, in offering his son Isaac upon the altar?
JAM|2|22||Seest thou, that his faith aided his works; and that by the works his faith was rendered complete?
JAM|2|23||And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: Abraham believed in God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God.
JAM|2|24||Thou seest, that by works a man is justified, and not by faith alone.
JAM|2|25||So also Rahab, the harlot, was not she justified by works, when she entertained the spies, and sent them forth by another way?
JAM|2|26||As the body without the spirit, is dead; so faith without works, is dead also.
JAM|3|1||Let there not be many teachers among you, my brethren; but know ye, that we are obnoxious to a severer judgment.
JAM|3|2||For we all offend in many things. Whoever offendeth not in discourse, is a perfect man, who can also keep his whole body in subjection.
JAM|3|3||Behold, we put bridles into the mouth of horses, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
JAM|3|4||Huge ships also, when strong winds drive them, are turned about by a small timber, to what place the pleasure of the pilot looketh.
JAM|3|5||So likewise the tongue is a small member, and it exalteth itself. Also a little fire inflameth large forests.
JAM|3|6||Now the tongue is a fire, and the world of sin is like a forest. And this tongue, which is one among our members, marreth our whole body; and it inflameth the series of our generations that roll on like a wheel; and it is itself on fire.
JAM|3|7||For all natures of beasts and birds and reptiles, of the sea or land, are subjugated by the nature of man.
JAM|3|8||But the tongue hath no one been able to tame: it is an evil thing, not coercible, and full of deadly poison.
JAM|3|9||For with it, we bless the Lord and Father; and with it we curse men, who were made in the image of God:
JAM|3|10||and from the same mouth, proceed curses and blessings. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.
JAM|3|11||Can there flow from the same fountain, sweet waters and bitter?
JAM|3|12||Or can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olives? or the vine, figs? So also salt waters cannot be made sweet.
JAM|3|13||Who is wise and instructed among you? Let him show his works in praiseworthy actions, with modest wisdom.
JAM|3|14||But if bitter envy be in you, or contention in your hearts, exalt not yourselves against the truth, and lie not.
JAM|3|15||For this wisdom cometh not down from above; but is earthly, and from the devices of the soul, and from demons.
JAM|3|16||For where envy and contention are, there also is confusion, and every thing wrong.
JAM|3|17||But the wisdom which is from above, is pure, and full of peace, and mild, and submissive, and full of compassion and of good fruits, and without partiality, and without respect of persons.
JAM|3|18||And the fruits of righteousness are sown in stillness, by them who make peace.
JAM|4|1||Whence is it, that there are among you fightings and broils? Is it not from the lusts, which war in your members?
JAM|4|2||Ye covet, and possess not; and ye kill, and envy, and effect nothing: and ye fight and make attacks; and ye have not, because ye ask not.
JAM|4|3||Ye ask, and receive not; because ye ask wickedly, that ye may pamper your lusts.
JAM|4|4||Ye adulterers, know ye not, that the love of the world is hostility towards God? He therefore who chooseth to be a lover of this world, is the enemy of God.
JAM|4|5||Or think ye, that the scripture hath vainly said: The spirit dwelling in us lusteth with envy?
JAM|4|6||But our Lord hath given us more grace. Therefore he said: The Lord humbleth the lofty, and giveth grace to the lowly.
JAM|4|7||Subject yourselves therefore to God; and stand firm against Satan, and he will flee from you.
JAM|4|8||Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: sanctify your hearts, ye divided in mind.
JAM|4|9||Humble yourselves, and mourn: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into grief.
JAM|4|10||Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
JAM|4|11||Speak not against each other, my brethren; for he that speaketh against his brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law. And if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but its judge.
JAM|4|12||There is one Law-giver and Judge, who can make alive, and [can] destroy: but who art thou, that thou judgest thy neighbor?
JAM|4|13||But what shall we say of those, who say: To-day or to-morrow we will go to such or such a city, and will abide there a year; and we will traffic, and get gain?
JAM|4|14||And they know not what will be to-morrow: for what is our life, but an exhalation that is seen a little while, and then vanisheth and is gone?
JAM|4|15||Whereas they should say: If the Lord please, and we live, we will do this or that.
JAM|4|16||They glory in their vaunting. All such glorying is evil.
JAM|4|17||He that knoweth the good, and doeth it not, to him is sin.
JAM|5|1||O ye rich ones, wail and weep, on account of the miseries that are coming upon you.
JAM|5|2||For your wealth is spoiled and putrid; and your garments are moth-eaten:
JAM|5|3||and your gold and your silver have contracted rust; and the rust of them will be testimony against you; and it will eat your flesh. Ye have heaped up a fire to you against the latter days.
JAM|5|4||Behold, the wages of the laborers who have reaped your ground, which ye have wrongfully retained, crieth out; and the clamor of the reapers hath entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
JAM|5|5||For ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and revelled, and feasted your bodies as in a day of slaughter.
JAM|5|6||Ye have condemned and slain the just, and none resisted you.
JAM|5|7||But, my brethren, be ye patient until the advent of the Lord; like the husbandman, who waiteth for the precious fruits of his ground, and is patient as to them, until he receive the early and the latter rain.
JAM|5|8||So also be ye patient, and fortify your hearts; for the advent of our Lord draweth nigh
JAM|5|9||Be not querulous one against another, my brethren, lest ye be judged: for lo, the judgment, standeth before the door.
JAM|5|10||For patience in your afflictions, my brethren, take to you the example of the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.
JAM|5|11||For lo, we ascribe blessedness to them who have borne suffering. Ye have heard of the patience of Job; and ye have seen the result which the Lord wrought for him: for the Lord is merciful and compassionate.
JAM|5|12||But above all things, my brethren, swear ye not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your language be yes, yes, and no, no, lest ye become obnoxious to judgment.
JAM|5|13||And if any of you shall be in affliction, let him pray; or if he be joyous, let him sing psalms.
JAM|5|14||And if one is sick, let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray for him, and anoint him with oil in the name of our Lord:
JAM|5|15||and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and our Lord will raise him up; and if sins have been committed by him, they will be forgiven him.
JAM|5|16||And confess ye your faults one to another, and pray ye one for another, that ye may be healed; for great is the efficacy of the prayer which a righteous man prayeth.
JAM|5|17||Elijah also was a man of sensations like us, and he prayed that rain might not descend upon the earth; and it descended not, for three years and six months.
JAM|5|18||And again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth gave forth its fruits.
JAM|5|19||My brethren, if one of you err from the way of truth, and any one convert him from his error;
JAM|5|20||let him know, that he who turneth the sinner from the error of his way, will resuscitate his soul from death, and will cover the multitude of his sins.
1PE|1|1||Peter, a legate of Jesus the Messiah, to the elect and sojourners, who are dispersed in Pontus and in Galatia, and in Cappadocia, and in Asia, and in Bithynia,
1PE|1|2||to them who have been chosen, by the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus the Messiah: May grace and peace abound towards you.
1PE|1|3||Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who in his great mercy hath begotten us anew, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, to the hope of life,
1PE|1|4||and to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, which is prepared for you in heaven;
1PE|1|5||while ye are kept, by the power of God and by faith, for the life that is prepared and will be revealed in the last times;
1PE|1|6||wherein ye will rejoice for ever, notwithstanding ye at the present time are pressed a little, by the various trials that pass over you;
1PE|1|7||so that the proof of your faith may appear more precious than refined gold that is tested by fire, unto glory and honor and praise, at the manifestation of Jesus the Messiah:
1PE|1|8||whom having not seen, ye love; and in the faith of whom ye rejoice, with joy that is glorious and ineffable,
1PE|1|9||that ye may receive the recompense of your faith, the life of your souls;
1PE|1|10||that life [namely], about which the prophets inquired, when they were prophesying of the grace which was to be given to you.
1PE|1|11||And they searched for the time which the Spirit of the Messiah dwelling in them did show and testify, when the sufferings of the Messiah were to occur, and his subsequent glory.
1PE|1|12||And it was revealed to them, [in regard to] all they were searching, that, not for themselves were they inquiring, but for us they were prophesying of those things, which are now manifested to you by means of the things we have announced to you, by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; which things the angels also desire to look into.
1PE|1|13||Wherefore, gird up the loins of your minds. and be awake perfectly, and wait for the joy, which will come to you at the revelation of our Lord Jesus the Messiah,
1PE|1|14||as obedient children: and be ye not conversant again with those former lusts, with which ye lusted when without knowledge.
1PE|1|15||But be ye holy in all your conduct, as he is holy who hath called you.
1PE|1|16||Because it is written: Be ye holy, even as I am holy.
1PE|1|17||And if so be ye call on the Father, with whom is no respect of persons, and who judgeth every one according to his deeds, pass the time of your sojournment with fear;
1PE|1|18||since ye know, that neither with perishable silver, nor with gold, ye were redeemed from your vain doings, which ye had by tradition from your fathers;
1PE|1|19||but with the precious blood of that Lamb in which is no spot nor blemish, namely, the Messiah:
1PE|1|20||who was predestined to this, before the foundation of the world; and was manifested at the termination of the times, for your sakes;
1PE|1|21||who, by means of him, have believed in God, who raised him from the dead and conferred glory on him; that your faith and hope might be in God,
1PE|1|22||while your minds became sanctified, by obedience to the truth; and ye be full of love, without respect of persons, so that ye love one another out of a pure and perfect heart;
1PE|1|23||like persons born again, not of seed that perisheth, but of that which doth not perish, by the living word of God, who abideth for ever.
1PE|1|24||Because all flesh is as grass, and all its beauty like the flower of the field. The grass drieth up, and the flower withereth away;
1PE|1|25||but the word of our God abideth for ever: and this is the word that is announced to you.
1PE|2|1||Therefore, cease ye from all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and backbiting.
1PE|2|2||And be like infant children; and crave the word, as being the pure spiritual milk by which ye are nourished up to life;
1PE|2|3||if ye have tasted and seen that the Lord is good:
1PE|2|4||to whom ye have come, because he is a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but with God elect and precious.
1PE|2|5||And ye also, as living stones, are builded and become spiritual temples, and holy priests, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices, acceptable before God, through Jesus the Messiah.
1PE|2|6||For it is said in the scripture, Behold, in Zion I lay a chosen and precious stone, for the head of the corner; and whoever believeth in him, will not be ashamed.
1PE|2|7||On you therefore who believe, is this honor conferred: but to them who believe not,
1PE|2|8||he is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence. And they stumble at it, because they believe not the word: whereto they were appointed.
1PE|2|9||But ye are an elect race, officiating as priests of the kingdom; a holy people, a redeemed congregation; that ye should proclaim the praises of him who called you out of darkness to his precious light:
1PE|2|10||who formerly were not accounted a people, but now are the people of God; and also, there were [once] no mercies on you, but now mercies are poured out upon you.
1PE|2|11||My beloved, I entreat you as strangers and pilgrims, separate yourselves from all lusts of the body; for they war against the soul.
1PE|2|12||And let your behavior be decorous before all men; so that they who utter evil speeches against you, may see your good actions, and may praise God in the day of trial.
1PE|2|13||And be ye submissive to all the sons of men, for God's sake; to kings, on account of their authority;
1PE|2|14||and to judges, because they are sent by him for the punishment of offenders, and for the praise of them that do well.
1PE|2|15||For so is the pleasure of God, that by your good deeds ye may stop the mouth of the foolish, who know not God:
1PE|2|16||as free men, yet not like men who make their freedom a cloak for their wickedness, but as the servants of God.
1PE|2|17||Honor all men; love your brethren; fear God; and honor kings.
1PE|2|18||And those among you who are servants, be subject to your masters, with reverence; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh and morose.
1PE|2|19||For there is favor before God for them who, for the sake of a good conscience, endure sorrows that come upon them wrongfully.
1PE|2|20||But they who endure afflictions on account of their offences, what praise have they? But if, when ye do well, they vex you, and ye endure it; then great is your praise with God.
1PE|2|21||For unto this were ye called; because the Messiah also died for us, and left us this pattern, that ye should walk in his steps.
1PE|2|22||He did no sin; neither was guile found in his mouth.
1PE|2|23||When he was reviled, he reviled not; and he suffered and threatened not, but committed his cause to the Judge of righteousness.
1PE|2|24||And he took away all our sins, and, in his body, lifted them to the cross; that we, when dead to sin, might live by his righteousness: for by his wounds, ye are healed.
1PE|2|25||For ye, [once] went astray, like sheep; but ye have now returned to the Shepherd and Curator of your souls.
1PE|3|1||So also ye wives, be ye subject to your husbands; that, by your pleasing behavior, ye may gain over, without difficulty, those who obey not the word,
1PE|3|2||when they see, that ye conduct yourselves with reverence and chastity.
1PE|3|3||And adorn not yourselves with the external ornaments of curls of the hair, or of golden trinkets, or of costly garments.
1PE|3|4||But adorn yourselves in the hidden person of the heart, with a mild and uncorrupted spirit, an ornament that is precious before God.
1PE|3|5||For so also the holy women of old, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, and were subject to their husbands:
1PE|3|6||just as Sarah was subject to Abraham, and called him, My lord: whose daughters ye are, by good works, while ye are not terrified by any fear.
1PE|3|7||And ye husbands, likewise, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, and hold them in honor, as the feebler vessels; because they also will inherit with you the gift of eternal life: and let not your prayers be hindered.
1PE|3|8||The summing up, is, that ye all be in harmony, that ye be sympathetic with them who suffer, and affectionate one to another, and be merciful and kind.
1PE|3|9||And that ye recompense to no one evil for evil, neither railing for railing; but, in contrariety to these, that ye bless: for to this were ye called, that ye might inherit a blessing.
1PE|3|10||Therefore, whoever chooseth life, and desireth to see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile;
1PE|3|11||let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and follow after it.
1PE|3|12||Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears [ready] to hear them: but the face of the Lord is against the wicked.
1PE|3|13||And who will do you harm, if ye are zealous of good works?
1PE|3|14||But if it should occur, that ye suffer on account of righteousness, happy are ye. And be not terrified, by those who would terrify you, nor be agitated:
1PE|3|15||but sanctify the Lord the Messiah, in your hearts. And be ye ready for a vindication, before every one who demandeth of you an account of the hope of your faith,
1PE|3|16||in meekness and respect, as having a good conscience; so that they who speak against you as bad men, may be ashamed, for having calumniated your good conduct in the Messiah.
1PE|3|17||For it is profitable to you, that ye suffer evil while ye do good deeds, if this should be the pleasure of God; and not, while ye do evil deeds.
1PE|3|18||For the Messiah also once died for our sins, the righteous for sinners; that he might bring you to God. And he died in body, but lived in spirit.
1PE|3|19||And he preached to those souls, which were detained in Hades,
1PE|3|20||which were formerly disobedient, in the days of Noah, when the long suffering of God commanded an ark to be made, in hope of their repentance; and eight souls only entered into it, and were kept alive in the waters.
1PE|3|21||And ye also, by a like figure, are made alive by baptism, (not when ye wash your bodies from filth, but when ye confess God with a pure conscience,) and by the resurrection of Jesus the Messiah;
1PE|3|22||who is taken up to heaven, and is on the right hand of God, and angels, and authorities, and powers, are subject to him.
1PE|4|1||If then the Messiah hath suffered for you in the flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind: for every one that is dead in his body, hath ceased from all sins,
1PE|4|2||that he may no longer be alive to the lusts of men, while he is in the body, but [only] to do the pleasure of God.
1PE|4|3||For the time that is past was enough, when ye wrought the pleasure of the profane, in dissoluteness, and in ebriety, and in lasciviousness, and in revelling, and in the worship of demons.
1PE|4|4||And lo, they now wonder, and reproach you, because ye revel not with them in the same former dissoluteness;
1PE|4|5||who must give account to God, who is to judge the living and the dead.
1PE|4|6||For on this account the announcement is made also to the dead, that they may be judged as persons in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit.
1PE|4|7||But the end of all things approacheth: therefore be sober, and be wakeful for prayer.
1PE|4|8||And above all things, have fervent love one towards another; for love covereth a multitude of sins.
1PE|4|9||And be ye compassionate to strangers, without murmuring.
1PE|4|10||And let each of you minister to his associates the gift which he hath received from God; as being good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
1PE|4|11||Whoever will speak, let him speak as the word of God: and whoever will minister, as of the ability that God hath given him: so that in all ye do, God may be glorified, through Jesus the Messiah; to whom belongeth glory, and honor, for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE|4|12||My beloved, be not dismayed at the trials that befall you, as if some strange thing had come upon you; for these things are for your probation.
1PE|4|13||But rejoice, that ye participate in the sufferings of the Messiah, that so ye may also rejoice and exult at the revelation of his glory.
1PE|4|14||And if ye are reproached on account of the name of the Messiah, happy are ye: for the glorious Spirit of God resteth upon you.
1PE|4|15||Only let none of you suffer, as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer.
1PE|4|16||But if he suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on account of this name.
1PE|4|17||For it is the time when judgment will commence with the house of God: and if it commence with us, what will be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
1PE|4|18||And if the righteous scarcely liveth, where will the ungodly and the sinner be found!
1PE|4|19||Wherefore, let them who suffer according to the pleasure of God, commend their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.
1PE|5|1||And I, an Elder, your associate, and a witness of the sufferings of the Messiah, and a participator in his glory which is to be revealed, entreat the Elders who are among you:
1PE|5|2||Feed ye the flock of God which is committed to you: have care [for it], spiritually; not from compulsion, but voluntarily; not for base gain, but with all your heart;
1PE|5|3||not as lords of the flock, but so as to be a good example for them:
1PE|5|4||that when the chief shepherd shall be revealed, ye may receive from him a crown of glory that fadeth not.
1PE|5|5||And ye juniors submit yourselves to your seniors; and clothe yourselves, stringently, with lowliness of mind one towards another; because God resisteth them who exalt themselves, and giveth grace to the humble.
1PE|5|6||Humble yourselves, therefore, under the powerful hand of God: and it will exalt you in due time.
1PE|5|7||And cast all your solicitude upon God; for he careth for you.
1PE|5|8||Be sober and guarded, because Satan your adversary, like a lion, roareth, and goeth about, and seeketh whom he may devour.
1PE|5|9||Therefore resist him, being steadfast in the faith: and know ye, that the same sufferings befall your brethren that are in the world.
1PE|5|10||Now it is the God of grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Jesus the Messiah, that hath given us, while we sustain these light afflictions, to be strengthened, and confirmed, and established by him for ever:
1PE|5|11||to whom be glory, and power, and honor, for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE|5|12||These as I account [them] few [things], I have written to you by Sylvanus, a faithful brother. And I would persuade, and would testify, that this is the true grace of God, this in which ye stand.
1PE|5|13||The elect church which is in Babylon, saluteth you; also Mark, my son.
1PE|5|14||Salute ye one another with a holy kiss. Peace be with you all, who are in the Messiah. Amen.
2PE|1|1||Simon Peter, a servant and legate of Jesus the Messiah, to those who have obtained equally precious faith with us, through the righteousness of Our Lord and Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah;
2PE|1|2||May grace and peace abound to you through the recognition of our Lord Jesus the Messiah,
2PE|1|3||as the giver to us of all things that be of the power of God, unto life and the fear of God, through the recognition of him who hath called us unto his own glory and moral excellence:
2PE|1|4||wherein he hath given you very great and precious promises; that by them ye might become partakers of the nature of God, while ye flee from the corruptions of the lusts that are in the world.
2PE|1|5||And, while ye apply all diligence in the matter, add to your faith moral excellence; and to moral excellence, knowledge;
2PE|1|6||and to knowledge, perseverance; and to perseverance, patience; and to patience, the fear of God;
2PE|1|7||and to the fear of God, sympathy with the brotherhood; and to sympathy with the brotherhood, love.
2PE|1|8||For, while these are found in you, and abounding, they render you not slothful, and not unfruitful, in the recognition of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
2PE|1|9||For he, in whom these things are not found, is blind and seeth not, and hath forgotten the purgation of his former sins.
2PE|1|10||And therefore, my brethren, be ye exceedingly diligent to make your calling and election sure, by your good actions: for, by so doing, ye will never fall away.
2PE|1|11||For thus will entrance be given you abundantly, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus the Messiah.
2PE|1|12||And for this reason I am not wearied in reminding you continually of these things; although ye know them well, and are established in this truth.
2PE|1|13||And it seemeth right to me, so long as I am in this body, to excite you by monition;
2PE|1|14||since I know, that the demise of my body is speedy, as also my Lord Jesus the Messiah hath showed me.
2PE|1|15||And I am anxious, that, after my departure, ye too may have it always with you to make mention of these things.
2PE|1|16||For we have not gone after fables artfully framed, in making known to you the power and advent of our Lord Jesus the Messiah; but [it was] after we had been spectators of his majesty.
2PE|1|17||For, when he received from God the Father honor and glory, and, after the splendid glory of his majesty, a voice came to him thus: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;
2PE|1|18||we also heard this identical voice from heaven, which came to him while we were with him in the holy mount.
2PE|1|19||And we have moreover a sure word of prophecy; and ye will do well, if ye look to it as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day shall dawn, and the sun shall arise in your hearts;
2PE|1|20||ye having the previous knowledge, that no prophecy is an exposition of its own text.
2PE|1|21||For at no time was it by the pleasure of man, that the prophecy came; but holy men of God spoke, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
2PE|2|1||But in the world, there have been also false prophets, as there will likewise be false teachers among you, who will bring in destructive heresies, denying the Lord that bought them; thus bringing on themselves swift destruction.
2PE|2|2||And many will go after their profaneness; on account of whom, the way of truth will be reproached.
2PE|2|3||And, in the cupidity of raving words, they will make merchandise of you: whose judgment, of a long time, is not idle; and their destruction slumbereth not.
2PE|2|4||For, if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to the infernal regions in chains of darkness, and delivered them up to be kept unto the judgment of torture,
2PE|2|5||and spared not the former world, but preserved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the wicked;
2PE|2|6||[and] burned up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and condemned them by an overthrow, making them a demonstration to the wicked who should come after them;
2PE|2|7||and also delivered righteous Lot, who was tormented with the filthy conduct of the lawless;
2PE|2|8||for that upright man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing from day to day, was distressed in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds;
2PE|2|9||the Lord knoweth how to rescue from afflictions those who fear him; and he will reserve the wicked for the day of judgment to be tormented,
2PE|2|10||and especially them who go after the flesh in the lusts of pollution, and despise government. Daring and arrogant, they shudder not with awe while they blaspheme;
2PE|2|11||whereas angels, greater than they in might and valor, bring not against them a reproachful denunciation.
2PE|2|12||But these, like the dumb beasts that by nature are for slaughter and corruption, while reviling the things they know not, will perish in their own corruption;
2PE|2|13||they being persons with whom iniquity is the reward of iniquity, and by them rioting in the daytime is accounted delightful; defiled and full of spots [are they], indulging themselves at their ease, while they give themselves up to pleasure;
2PE|2|14||having eyes that are full of adultery, and sins that never end; seducing unstable souls; and having a heart exercised in cupidity; children of malediction:
2PE|2|15||and, having left the way of rectitude, they have wandered and gone in the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of iniquity,
2PE|2|16||and who had for the reprover of his transgression a dumb ass, which, speaking with the speech of men, rebuked the madness of the prophet.
2PE|2|17||These are wells without water, clouds driven by a tempest, persons for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness.
2PE|2|18||For, while they utter astonishing vanity, they seduce, with obscene lusts of the flesh, them who have almost abandoned these that walk in error.
2PE|2|19||And they promise them liberty, while they themselves are the slaves of corruption: for, by whatever thing a man is vanquished, to that is he enslaved.
2PE|2|20||For if, when they have escaped the pollutions of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus the Messiah, they become again involved in the same, and are vanquished, their latter state is worse than the former.
2PE|2|21||For it would have been better for them, not to have known the way of righteousness, than after having known [it], to turn back from the holy commandment that was delivered to them.
2PE|2|22||But the true proverb hath happened to them: the dog returneth to his vomit and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.
2PE|3|1||This second epistle, my beloved, I now write to you; in [both of] which I stir up your honest mind by admonition:
2PE|3|2||that ye may be mindful of the words which were formerly spoken by the holy prophets, and of the injunction of our Lord and Redeemer by the hand of the legates:
2PE|3|3||knowing this previously, that there will come in the last days scoffers, who will scoff, walking according to their own lusts;
2PE|3|4||and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, since our fathers fell asleep, every thing remaineth just as from the beginning of the creation.
2PE|3|5||For this they willingly forget, that the heavens were of old; and the earth rose up from the waters, and by means of water, by the word of God.
2PE|3|6||[And], by means of these [waters], the world which then was, [being submerged] again perished in the waters.
2PE|3|7||And the heavens that now are, and the earth, are by his word stored up, being reserved for the fire at the day of judgment and the perdition of wicked men.
2PE|3|8||And of this one thing, my beloved, be not forgetful, That one day, to the Lord, is as a thousand years; and a thousand years, as one day.
2PE|3|9||The Lord doth not procrastinate his promises, as some estimate procrastination; but he is long suffering, for your sakes, being not willing that any should perish, but that every one should come to repentance.
2PE|3|10||And the day of the Lord will come, like a thief; in which the heavens will suddenly pass away; and the elements, being ignited, will be dissolved; and the earth and the works in it, will not be found.
2PE|3|11||As therefore all these things are to be dissolved, what persons ought ye to be, in holy conduct, and in the fear of God,
2PE|3|12||expecting and desiring the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being tried by fire will be dissolved, and the elements being ignited will melt?
2PE|3|13||But we, according to his promise, expect new heavens, and a new earth, in which righteousness dwelleth.
2PE|3|14||Therefore, my beloved, as ye expect these things, strive that ye may be found by him in peace, without spot and without blemish.
2PE|3|15||And account the long suffering of the Lord to be redemption; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom conferred on him, wrote to you;
2PE|3|16||as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which there is something difficult to be understood; [and] which they who are ignorant and unstable, pervert, as they do also the rest of the scriptures, to their own destruction.
2PE|3|17||Ye therefore, my beloved, as ye know [these things] beforehand, guard yourselves, lest, by going after the error of the lawless, ye fall from your steadfastness.
2PE|3|18||But be ye growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus the Messiah, and of God the Father: whose is the glory, now, and always, and to the days of eternity. Amen.
1JN|1|1||We announce to you that, which was from the beginning, which we have heard, and have seen with our eyes, looked upon, and handled with our hands, that which is the word of life.
1JN|1|2||And the life was manifested, and we have seen and do testify and announce to you, the life which is eternal; which was with the Father, and was revealed to us.
1JN|1|3||And what we have seen and heard, we make known to you also, that ye may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus the Messiah.
1JN|1|4||And these things we write to you, that our joy in you may be complete.
1JN|1|5||And this is the announcement, which we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light, and no darkness at all is in him.
1JN|1|6||And if we say that we have fellowship with him, and we walk in the darkness, we are liars, and walk not in the truth.
1JN|1|7||But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all our sins.
1JN|1|8||And if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
1JN|1|9||But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all our iniquity.
1JN|1|10||If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not with us.
1JN|2|1||My children, these things I write to you, that ye sin not. But if any one should sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus the Messiah, the righteous.
1JN|2|2||For he is himself the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for all the world.
1JN|2|3||And by this we shall be sensible that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1JN|2|4||For he that saith, I know him, and doth not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1JN|2|5||But he that keepeth his word, in him is the love of God truly completed: for by this we know that we are in him.
1JN|2|6||He that saith, I am in him, is bound to walk according to his walkings.
1JN|2|7||My beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but the old commandment which ye had from the beginning; and the old commandment is the word, which ye have heard.
1JN|2|8||Again, a new commandment I write to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness hath passed away, and the true light beginneth to appear.
1JN|2|9||Whoever therefore shall say that he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.
1JN|2|10||He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and in him is no stumbling.
1JN|2|11||But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness; and he knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1JN|2|12||I write to you, ye children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
1JN|2|13||I write to you, ye fathers, because ye have known him who existed from the beginning. I write to you, ye young men, because ye have vanquished the evil one.
1JN|2|14||I have written to you, ye little ones, because ye have known the Father. I have written to you, ye fathers, because ye have known him who [was] from the beginning, I have written to you, ye young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God dwelleth in you, and ye have vanquished the evil one.
1JN|2|15||Love not the world, nor any thing in it; for whoever loveth the world, hath not the love of the Father in him.
1JN|2|16||For all that is in the world, is, the lust of the body, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world; which are not from the Father, but from the world itself.
1JN|2|17||And the world is passing away, [both] it and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the pleasure of God, abideth for ever.
1JN|2|18||My children, it is the latter time; and as ye have heard that a false Messiah was to arise, so there are now many false Messiahs; and from this we know that it is the latter time.
1JN|2|19||From us they went out, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out from us, that so it might be known, that they were not of us.
1JN|2|20||But ye have an unction from the Holy [One]; and ye discriminate every person.
1JN|2|21||I have not written to you, because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no falsehood is of the truth.
1JN|2|22||Who is false, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Messiah? And that person is a false Messiah. He that denieth the Father, denieth also the Son.
1JN|2|23||And he that denieth the Son, also believeth not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, confesseth also the Father.
1JN|2|24||And what ye heard from the first, let that remain with you. For if that, which ye heard from the first, remaineth with you, ye also will remain in the Father and in the Son.
1JN|2|25||And this is the promise, which he hath promised us, [even] life eternal.
1JN|2|26||And these things I have written to you, on account of those who seduce you.
1JN|2|27||And ye also, if the unction which ye have received from him remaineth in you, need not that any one should teach you; but as that unction is from God, it teacheth you all things; and it is true, and no falsehood is in it. And as it hath taught you, remain ye in him.
1JN|2|28||And now, my children, remain ye in him; that so, when he shall be manifested, we may not be ashamed before him, but may have an open countenance at his coming.
1JN|2|29||If ye know that he is righteous, ye also know, that whoever doeth righteousness, is from him.
1JN|3|1||And ye see, how great is the love of the Father towards us, who hath called us sons, and made us [such]. Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it likewise knoweth him not.
1JN|3|2||My beloved, now are we the sons of God; and hitherto, it hath not appeared what we are to be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be in his likeness, and we shall see him as he is.
1JN|3|3||And every one that hath this hope from him, purifieth himself, as he is pure.
1JN|3|4||And every one that practiseth sin, perpetrateth iniquity; for all sin is iniquity.
1JN|3|5||And ye know, that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him was no sin.
1JN|3|6||And every one that abideth in him, sinneth not: and every one that sinneth, hath not seen him, nor hath known him.
1JN|3|7||My children, let no one deceive you: he that doeth righteousness, is righteous, as the Messiah also is righteous.
1JN|3|8||And he that committeth sin, is of Satan; because Satan was a sinner from the beginning: and for this cause, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of Satan.
1JN|3|9||Every one that is born of God, doth not practise sin; because his seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
1JN|3|10||By this are the children of God discriminated from the children of Satan. Every one that practiseth not righteousness, and that loveth not his brother, is not of God:
1JN|3|11||because this is the commandment, which ye heard from the beginning, that ye should love one another.
1JN|3|12||Not like Cain, who was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And why did he slay him, but because his own works were evil, and those of his brother righteous?
1JN|3|13||And wonder not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
1JN|3|14||We know that we have turned from death unto life, by this, that we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother, remaineth in death.
1JN|3|15||For every one that hateth his brother, is a man-slayer; and ye know, that no man-slayer can have eternal life abiding in him.
1JN|3|16||By this we know his love towards us, because he gave up his life for us: and we also ought to give up our lives for our brethren.
1JN|3|17||But whoever hath worldly possessions, and seeth his brother in want, and shutteth up his bowels from him, how is the love of God in him?
1JN|3|18||My children, let us not love one another in words and in tongue, but in acts and in truth.
1JN|3|19||And by this, we recognize that we are of the truth; and, before he shall come, we make our hearts confident.
1JN|3|20||But if our heart condemneth us, how much greater is God than our heart, and knowing all things?
1JN|3|21||My beloved, if our heart condemneth us not, we have open countenances before God.
1JN|3|22||And whatever we ask, we receive from him; because we keep his commandments, and do acceptable things before him.
1JN|3|23||And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus the Messiah, and that we love one another as he hath commanded us.
1JN|3|24||And he that keepeth his commandments, is kept by him, and he dwelleth in him: and by this we understand that he abideth in us, from his Spirit which he hath given to us.
1JN|4|1||My beloved, believe not all spirits; but discriminate among spirits, whether they are of God: for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
1JN|4|2||By this the Spirit of God is known, every spirit that confesseth that Jesus the Messiah hath come in the flesh, is of God.
1JN|4|3||And every spirit which confesseth not that Jesus the Messiah hath come in the flesh, is not of God; but he is of the false Messiah, of whom ye have heard that he cometh, and now is he already in the world.
1JN|4|4||But ye children, are of God; and ye have overcome them, because greater is he who is in you, than he who is in the world.
1JN|4|5||And they are of the world: therefore they speak from the world, and the world heareth them.
1JN|4|6||But we are of God; and he that knoweth God, heareth us; and he that is not of God, heareth us not. By this, we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1JN|4|7||My beloved, let us love one another: because love is from God; and whoever loveth, is born of God and knoweth God.
1JN|4|8||Because God is love; and whoever loveth not, doth not know God.
1JN|4|9||By this was the love of God towards us made known, because God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we by him might live.
1JN|4|10||In this is love; it was not that we loved God, but that God loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.
1JN|4|11||My beloved, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
1JN|4|12||No one hath ever seen God; but if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
1JN|4|13||And by this we know, that we abide in him and that he abideth in us, because he hath given of his Spirit to us.
1JN|4|14||And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son, a Redeemer for the world.
1JN|4|15||Whoever confesseth Jesus to be the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he abideth in God.
1JN|4|16||And we have believed and known the love, which God hath towards us: for God is love, and whoever abideth in love, abideth in God.
1JN|4|17||And hereby is his love perfected with us; that we may have open countenances in the day of judgment; because as he was, so also are we in this world.
1JN|4|18||In love there is no fear; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear existeth in peril, and he that feareth is not perfected in love.
1JN|4|19||Let us, therefore, love God; because he hath first loved us.
1JN|4|20||And if any one shall say, I love God, and yet hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother who is visible, how can he love God who is invisible?
1JN|4|21||And this command we have received from him, that whoever loveth God, must love also his brother.
1JN|5|1||Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Messiah, is born of God. And whoever loveth the begetter, loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1JN|5|2||And by this we know, that we love the children of God, when we love God, and follow his commandments.
1JN|5|3||For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not burdensome.
1JN|5|4||Because, whoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, our faith.
1JN|5|5||For who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN|5|6||This is he who came by the water and the blood. Jesus the Messiah; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit testifieth; because the Spirit is truth.
1JN|5|7||[For there are three that testify in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.]
1JN|5|8||And there are three witnesses, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are in union.
1JN|5|9||If we receive the testimony of men, how much greater is the testimony of God? And this is the testimony of God, which he hath testified concerning his Son.
1JN|5|10||Whoever believeth in the Son of God, hath this testimony in himself. And whoever believeth not God, hath made him a liar, by not believing the testimony which God hath testified concerning his Son.
1JN|5|11||And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us life eternal, and this life is in his Son.
1JN|5|12||Every one that taketh hold of the Son, taketh hold of life; and every one that taketh not hold of the Son, hath not life.
1JN|5|13||These things have I written to you, that ye may know that ye have life eternal, ye who believe in the name of the Son of God.
1JN|5|14||And this is the confidence that we have towards him, that whatever we ask of him, agreeably to his will, he heareth us.
1JN|5|15||And if we are persuaded that he heareth us respecting what we ask of him, we are confident of receiving presently the petitions which we asked of him.
1JN|5|16||If any one shall see his brother sin a sin which doth not deserve death, he shall ask, and life will be given him, to them [I say] who sin not as unto death. For there is a sin of death; and I do not say of this, that a man should pray for it.
1JN|5|17||For all iniquity is sin; and there is a sin which is not of death.
1JN|5|18||And we know, that every one who is born of God, sinneth not: for he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.
1JN|5|19||We know, that we are of God; and all the world is reposing on the evil one.
1JN|5|20||And we know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given us knowledge that we might know the True One; and that we might be in the True One, in his Son Jesus the Messiah. He is the true God, and the life eternal.
1JN|5|21||My children, keep yourselves from idolatry.
2JN|1|1||The Elder, to Kuria the elect, and to her children: whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but all they who know the truth;
2JN|1|2||for the sake of the truth, which abideth in us and is with us for ever.
2JN|1|3||May grace be with you, and mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus the Messiah, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
2JN|1|4||I have rejoiced greatly, that I found [some] of thy children, who walked in the truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.
2JN|1|5||And now, I beseech thee, Kuria, (I write no new commandment to thee, but that which was with us from the beginning,) that we should love one another.
2JN|1|6||And this is love, that we walk according to the commandment. This is the commandment, as ye have heard from the beginning, that we should walk in it.
2JN|1|7||Because many seducers have gone forth into the world, who confess not that Jesus the Messiah hath come in the flesh. This is a seducer and Antichrist.
2JN|1|8||Take heed to yourselves, that ye lose not what ye have wrought; but that ye may be recompensed with a full reward.
2JN|1|9||Every one who transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of the Messiah, God is not in him. And he who abideth in his doctrine, he hath the Father and the Son.
2JN|1|10||If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, entertain him not in your house, nor say to him, Joy to thee:
2JN|1|11||for he that saith to him, Joy to thee, is a participator in his evil deeds.
2JN|1|12||Having many things I could write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you, and to converse mouth to mouth, that our joy may be complete.
2JN|1|13||The children of thy elect sister salute thee. Grace be with you. Amen.
3JN|1|1||The Elder, to my beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3JN|1|2||Our beloved; in all things, I pray for thee that thou mayest prosper and be in health, as thy soul doth prosper.
3JN|1|3||For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified concerning thy integrity, even as thou walkest in the truth.
3JN|1|4||And I have no greater joy, than to hear that my children walk in the truth.
3JN|1|5||Our beloved, thou doest in faith, what thou performest towards the brethren; and especially towards strangers,
3JN|1|6||who have borne testimony to thy charity before the whole church, to whom thou doest good, as is pleasing to God.
3JN|1|7||For they went forth in behalf of his name, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3JN|1|8||We therefore ought to receive such persons, that we may be aiders of the truth.
3JN|1|9||I was desirous of writing to the church; but he who loveth to be foremost among them, Diotrephes, receiveth us not.
3JN|1|10||Therefore, if he come, remember those his doings, that he treated us with malignant words; and this not sufficing him, he received not the brethren; and those who would receive [them], he prohibited, and even ejected them from the church.
3JN|1|11||Our beloved, be not a follower of what is evil, but of what is good. He that doeth good, is of God; but he that doeth evil, hath not seen God.
3JN|1|12||Of Demetrius, there is good testimony from every one, and from the church, and from the truth itself: and we also bear [him] testimony, and ye know that our testimony is true.
3JN|1|13||I had many things to write to thee; but I will not write [them] to thee with ink and pen.
3JN|1|14||But I hope soon to see thee, and to converse mouth to mouth.
3JN|1|15||Peace be with thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends, severally, by name.
JUD|1|1||Jude, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, and the brother of James, to the called people, the beloved of God the Father, the preserved by Jesus the Messiah:
JUD|1|2||Mercy and peace in love, be multiplied to you.
JUD|1|3||My beloved, while I take all pains to write to you of our common life, it is needful for me to write to you, exhorting you to maintain a conflict for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.
JUD|1|4||For some have obtained entrance, who from the beginning were registered beforehand under this condemnation: wicked men, who pervert the grace of God to impurity, and deny him who is the only Lord God and our Lord, Jesus the Messiah.
JUD|1|5||And I wish to remind you, though ye all know it, that God, after once rescuing the people from Egypt, again destroyed them who believed not.
JUD|1|6||And the angels that kept not their primacy, but left their station, he hath reserved in chains unknown, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.
JUD|1|7||As Sodom and Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities, which in like manner followed whoredom and went after strange flesh, are placed beneath everlasting fire, being, doomed to judgment.
JUD|1|8||In the same manner, too, these sensual dreamers defile the flesh and despise authority, and revile excellency.
JUD|1|9||But Michael the archangel, who, in debate with the Accuser, contended about the body of Moses, did not venture to bring against him a reviling declaration; but said, The Lord will rebuke thee.
JUD|1|10||But these [men] revile things which they do not understand; and in the things of which they have a natural persuasion as animal beings, in these they corrupt themselves.
JUD|1|11||Woe to them; for they have gone in the way of Cain; and, after the error of Balaam, they have lusted for gain; and, in the rebellion of Korah, they have perished.
JUD|1|12||These are they who, in their feastings, riot while polluting themselves, feeding themselves without fear; clouds without rain, moved about by the winds; trees whose fruit hath failed, and they are without fruit, twice dead, and uplifted from their root;
JUD|1|13||raging waves of the sea, which, by their foam, manifest their confusion; shootingstars, for which is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
JUD|1|14||And of them also prophesied Enoch, who was the seventh from Adam, when he said: Behold, the Lord cometh, with myriads of his saints;
JUD|1|15||to execute judgment upon all; and to convict all the wicked, because of all the deeds they have wickedly committed; and because of all the hard speeches, which they, ungodly sinners, have uttered.
JUD|1|16||These are they who murmur and complain of every thing, while they walk according to their lusts; and their mouth speaketh shocking things; and they flatter people, for the sake of gain.
JUD|1|17||But do ye, my beloved, remember the words which were before spoken by the legates of our Lord Jesus the Messiah;
JUD|1|18||because they told you, that in the end of the times there would be scoffers, going after wickedness, according to their lusts.
JUD|1|19||These are they that separate [themselves], sensual persons, not having the Spirit.
JUD|1|20||But, my beloved, be ye built up anew, in your holy faith, through the Holy Spirit, while ye pray.
JUD|1|21||And let us keep ourselves in the love of God, while we wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus the Messiah unto our eternal life.
JUD|1|22||And some of them, snatch ye from the fire.
JUD|1|23||And when they repent, have compassion on them, with fear, hating even the tunic that is defiled by the flesh.
JUD|1|24||And to him who is able to preserve you faultless, and spotless, and to establish you without a blemish,
JUD|1|25||before his majesty, with joy, [namely,] the only God, our Deliverer, by means of Jesus the Messiah our Lord, be praise, and dominion, and honor, and majesty, both now and in all ages. Amen.
REV|1|1||The Revelation of Jesus the Messiah, which God gave to him, to show to his servants the things that must shortly occur: and he signified [it] by sending, through his angel, to his servant John;
REV|1|2||who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus the Messiah, as to all that he saw.
REV|1|3||Blessed is he that readeth, and they who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it; for the time is near.
REV|1|4||John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and quietude, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
REV|1|5||and from Jesus the Messiah, the Witness, the Faithful, the First-born of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth; who hath loved us, and released us from our sins by his blood;
REV|1|6||and hath made us a kingdom sacerdotal to God and his Father: to whom be glory and power, for ever and ever. Amen.
REV|1|7||Behold, he cometh with clouds; and all eyes shall see him, and also they who speared him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn on account of him. Yes: Amen.
REV|1|8||I am Alpha, also Omega, saith the Lord God; who is, and was, and is to come, the omnipotent.
REV|1|9||I John, your brother, and partaker with you in the affliction and suffering that are in Jesus the Messiah, was in the island called Patmos, because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus the Messiah.
REV|1|10||I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, which said:
REV|1|11||That which thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
REV|1|12||And I turned myself to look at the voice that talked with me; and when I had turned, I saw seven candlesticks of gold;
REV|1|13||and, in the midst of the candlesticks, one like the Son of man, clothed to the feet, and girded about his paps with a girdle of gold.
REV|1|14||And his head and his hair were white, like white wool, like snow; and his eyes, like a flame of fire:
REV|1|15||and his feet were like fine brass, flaming in a furnace: and his voice, like the sound of many waters.
REV|1|16||And he had in his right hand seven stars; and from his mouth issued a sharp twoedged sword; and his visage was like the sun shining in its strength.
REV|1|17||And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, and said, Fear not: I am the First and the Last;
REV|1|18||and who liveth and was dead; and behold, I am alive for ever and ever. Amen. And I have the keys of death and of the unseen world.
REV|1|19||Therefore, write what thou hast seen, and the things that are; and the things that are to be hereafter:
REV|1|20||the mystery of these seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven candlesticks of gold. Those seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.
REV|2|1||To the angel of the church which is at Ephesus write: These things saith he who holdeth all things, and the seven stars, in his right hand; he that walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold;
REV|2|2||I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy patience, and [that] thou canst not endure the wicked; and thou hast tried them who say they are legates, and are not; and thou hast found them liars.
REV|2|3||And thou hast had patience, and hast borne the burden, on account of my name, and hast not fainted.
REV|2|4||Yet I have [a charge] against thee, on account of thy former love, which thou hast left.
REV|2|5||Therefore remember whence thou hast fallen; and repent, and do the former works: or if not, I will come to thee quickly, and I will remove thy candlestick from its place, except thou repent.
REV|2|6||But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also [hate].
REV|2|7||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him who is victorious, will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of my God.
REV|2|8||And to the angel of the church which is at Smyrna, write: These things saith the First and the Last, he who was dead, and liveth.
REV|2|9||I know thy works, and the affliction, and the poverty, (yet thou art rich;) and the railing which is from them who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are of the congregation of Satan.
REV|2|10||Be not terrified at any of the things thou art to suffer. For lo, the Accuser will throw some of you into custody, that ye may be tried; and there will be trouble to you ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
REV|2|11||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that is victorious, shall not be harmed by the second death.
REV|2|12||And to the angel of the church at Pergamos, write: Thus saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword;
REV|2|13||I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where the throne of Satan is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied the faith of me, in those days when my faithful witness, who was slain among you, was made a spectacle where Satan dwelleth.
REV|2|14||Yet I have a small [charge] against thee. Thou hast there them who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, that they might eat the sacrifices of idols, and might commit whoredom.
REV|2|15||So also thou hast them who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans. In like manner, repent thou.
REV|2|16||Or if not, I will come to thee quickly, and I will war upon them with the sword of my mouth.
REV|2|17||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that is victorious, will I give to eat of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white counter, and upon the counter a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
REV|2|18||And to the angel of the church at Thyatira, write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass:
REV|2|19||I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and also thy patience; and that these thy latter works are more than the former.
REV|2|20||But I have [a charge] against thee, because thou sufferest thy woman Jezabel, who saith she is a prophetess, and teacheth, and seduceth my servants to whoredom, and to eating of the sacrifices of idols.
REV|2|21||And I gave her a season for repentance, and she is not disposed to repent of her whoredom.
REV|2|22||Behold, I will cast her upon a bed, and them who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.
REV|2|23||And her children will I slay with death: and all the churches shall know, that I am he who searcheth reins and hearts; and I will render to each of you according to your works.
REV|2|24||And I say to you, to the rest that are in Thyatira, to all them who have not received this doctrine, the men who have not known the profound things of Satan, as they say; I lay no other burden upon you:
REV|2|25||but, what ye have, hold fast until I come.
REV|2|26||And to him that is victorious, and to him that observeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority, over the nations;
REV|2|27||and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and like vessels of pottery, shall they be broken: as I also have received of my Father.
REV|2|28||And I will give him the morning star.
REV|2|29||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV|3|1||And to the angel of the church which is at Sardis, write: These things saith he who hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead.
REV|3|2||Awake, and preserve the things that remain, which are ready to die; for I have not found thy works complete before my God.
REV|3|3||Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard; and observe [those precepts], and repent. If then thou wilt not wake up, I will come upon thee as a thief; and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.
REV|3|4||Yet thou hast a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
REV|3|5||He that is victorious, shall be so clothed in white robes; and I will not blot out their name from the book of life; and I will confess their name before my Father, and before his angels.
REV|3|6||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV|3|7||And to the angel of the church which is at Philadelphia, write: These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, who openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth;
REV|3|8||I know thy works. And lo, I have set before thee an open door, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength; and thou hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
REV|3|9||Behold, I will give them of the congregation of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but lie, behold I will make them to come and do obeisance before thy feet; and to know that I have loved thee.
REV|3|10||Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, that is to come on all the inhabited world, to try them who dwell on the earth.
REV|3|11||I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, so that no one take thy crown.
REV|3|12||Him that is victorious, will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall not again go out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and of the new Jerusalem which descendeth from heaven from my God, and my own new name.
REV|3|13||He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV|3|14||And to the angel of the church which is at Laodicea, write: These things saith the Amen, the witness, the faithful, the true, the Chief of the creation of God:
REV|3|15||I know thy works, that thou art neither hot, nor cold; I would that thou wert cold or hot.
REV|3|16||So, because thou art lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit thee from my mouth.
REV|3|17||Because thou sayest, I am rich and affluent, and have no want of any thing; and thou knowest not, that thou art impotent, and miserable, and needy, and blind, and naked;
REV|3|18||I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white raiment, to be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be seen; and put eye-salve on thine eyes, that thou mayest see.
REV|3|19||As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be emulous therefore, and repent.
REV|3|20||Behold, I have been standing at the door, and I will knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
REV|3|21||And to him that is victorious, to him will I give to sit with me on my throne, even as I was victorious, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
REV|3|22||He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
REV|4|1||After these things, I looked and lo, a door [was] open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard, was as of a trumpet talking with me. It said, Come up hither; and I will show thee the things that must occur hereafter.
REV|4|2||Instantly, I was in the Spirit: and lo, a throne was placed in heaven; and there was [one] seated on the throne.
REV|4|3||And he who sat, was like the appearance of a jasper-stone, and of a sardine [sard], and of a rainbow of the clouds, round about the throne, in form as the appearance of emeralds.
REV|4|4||Around the throne were twenty and four seats; and upon those seats sat twenty and four Elders, who were clothed in white robes, and on whose heads were coronets of gold.
REV|4|5||And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and the sound of thunders; and seven lamps of fire were burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
REV|4|6||And before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and around it, and before the throne, were four Animals, full of eyes in their front and in their rear.
REV|4|7||And the first Animal resembled a lion; and the second Animal resembled a calf; and the third Animal had a face like a man; and the fourth Animal resembled an eagle when flying.
REV|4|8||And these four Animals had, each of them, six wings around it: and within they were full of eyes: and they have no cessation, day or night, from saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord God, the Omnipotent, who was, and is, and is to come.
REV|4|9||And when these Animals give glory and honor and praise to him that sitteth on the throne, to him who liveth for ever and ever,
REV|4|10||the twenty and four Elders fall down before him who sitteth on the throne, and they worship him who liveth for ever and ever; and they cast their coronets before the throne, saying,
REV|4|11||Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, the Holy, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thee they exist; and because of thy pleasure they had being and were created.
REV|5|1||And I saw, at the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book, which was written within and on the back side, and which was sealed with seven seals.
REV|5|2||And I saw a strong angel, who proclaimed with a loud voice, Who is competent to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
REV|5|3||And no one either in heaven above, or on the earth, or beneath the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
REV|5|4||And I wept much, because no one was found, who was competent to open the book, or to look on it.
REV|5|5||And one of the Elders said to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath been victorious: He will open the book, and its seven seals.
REV|5|6||And I looked, and in the midst of the Elders stood a lamb, as if slain; and it had seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God that are sent into all the earth.
REV|5|7||And he came, and took the book from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
REV|5|8||And when he took the book, the four Animals and the twenty and four Elders fell down before the Lamb, each of them having a harp, and cups of gold full of odors, which are the supplications of the saints.
REV|5|9||And they sung a new anthem, saying: Competent art thou, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
REV|5|10||and thou hast made them kings and priests to our God; and they reign on the earth.
REV|5|11||And I looked, and I heard, as it were the voice of many angels, around the throne, and the Animals and the Elders; and the number of them was a myriad of myriads, and thousand of thousands,
REV|5|12||who said, with a loud voice; Competent is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing;
REV|5|13||and [to be over] every created thing, that is in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, or in the sea; and all that are in them. And I heard him who sat on the throne say: Unto the Lamb be given, blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, for ever and ever.
REV|5|14||And the four Animals said: Amen. And the Elders fell down, and adored.
REV|6|1||And, when the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, I looked, and I heard one of the four Animals say, as with a voice of thunder, Come, and see.
REV|6|2||And I looked, and there was a white horse: and he who sat on it, had a bow; and a coronet was given to him, and he went forth conquering, that he might conquer.
REV|6|3||And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second Animal say, Come.
REV|6|4||And there went forth another, a red horse; and to him who sat thereon, it was given, to take tranquillity from the earth; and that they should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.
REV|6|5||And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third Animal say, Come, and see. And I looked, and lo, a black horse; and he that sat thereon, had a balance in his hand.
REV|6|6||And I heard a voice in the midst of the four Animals, saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenices of barley for a denarius; and hurt not the oil and the wine.
REV|6|7||And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth Animal say, Come, and see.
REV|6|8||And I looked, and lo, a pale horse; and the name of him who sat thereon was Death; and Hades followed after him. And there was given him authority over the fourth part of the earth, to slay with the sword, and by famine, and by death, and by the ravenous beast of the earth.
REV|6|9||And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them who were slain on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony to the Lamb which was with them.
REV|6|10||And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Lord, thou holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
REV|6|11||And to each one of them was given a white robe; and it was told them, that they must be quiet yet a little while, until the consummation of their fellow-servants and brethren, who were to be killed as they had been.
REV|6|12||And I looked, when he had opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black, like sackcloth of hair; and the whole moon became like blood.
REV|6|13||And the stars of heaven fell on the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its unripe figs, when it is shaken by a strong wind.
REV|6|14||And the heavens separated, as a book is rolled up: and all mountains and islands were removed out of their places.
REV|6|15||And the kings of the earth, and the nobles, and the captains of thousands, and the rich men, and the men of valor, and every servant and free man, hid themselves in caves, and in the clefts of the mountains;
REV|6|16||and they said to the mountains and to the clefts, Fall over us, and hide us from the face of him who sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
REV|6|17||For the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand?
REV|7|1||And after these things I saw four angels, who stood on the four corners of the earth; and they held the four winds of the earth, so that the wind blew not on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on the trees.
REV|7|2||And I saw another angel, and he came up from the rising of the sun; and he had the seal of the living God; and he called out, with a loud voice, to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying:
REV|7|3||Hurt ye not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.
REV|7|4||And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed from every tribe of Israelites.
REV|7|5||Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed: of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand:
REV|7|6||of the tribe of Ashur, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand:
REV|7|7||of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand:
REV|7|8||of the tribe of Zebulon, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand: of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand.
REV|7|9||And after these things, I looked, and lo, a great multitude, which no one could number, from all kindreds, and nations, and tribes, and tongues; who stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands;
REV|7|10||and they cried, with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God, to him who sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb.
REV|7|11||And all the angels stood around the throne and the Elders and the four Animals; and they fell upon their faces before his throne, and worshipped God,
REV|7|12||saying: Amen. Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, [be] to our God, for ever and ever: Amen.
REV|7|13||And one of the Elders turned, and said to me: These who are clothed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they?
REV|7|14||And I said to him: My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they who came from great affliction; and they have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
REV|7|15||Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night, in his temple; and he who sitteth on the throne, will protect them:
REV|7|16||they will not hunger, nor thirst any more; nor will the sun fall on them, nor any heat.
REV|7|17||Because the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, will feed them; and will lead them to fountains of living water; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.
REV|8|1||And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven, for about half an hour.
REV|8|2||And I saw the seven angels, who stood before God; and to them were given, seven trumpets.
REV|8|3||And another angel came and stood by the altar; and he held a golden censer: and much incense was given him, so that he might offer, with the prayers of all the saints, upon the golden altar before the throne.
REV|8|4||And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints went up before God from the hand of the angel.
REV|8|5||And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there were thunders, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake.
REV|8|6||And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.
REV|8|7||And the first sounded; and there was hail, and fire, which were mingled with water: and these were thrown upon the earth; and a third part of the earth was burned up, and a third part of the trees were burned, and all green grass was burned.
REV|8|8||And the second angel sounded, and, as it were a great mountain burning with fire, was cast into the sea; and also a third part of the sea became blood.
REV|8|9||And a third part of all the creatures in the sea, that had life, died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.
REV|8|10||And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a star, burning like a lamp; and it fell upon a third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of water.
REV|8|11||And the name of the star was called Wormwood; and a third part of the waters became wormwood; and many persons died from the waters, because they were bitter.
REV|8|12||And the fourth angel sounded, and a third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them were dark, and they became dark; and the day did not give light for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.
REV|8|13||And I saw and heard an eagle, which flew in the midst, and it had a tail of blood, while it said, with a loud voice: Woe, woe, to them who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels, who are to sound.
REV|9|1||And the fifth angel sounded; and I saw a star, which fell from heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.
REV|9|2||And he opened the pit of the abyss; and smoke issued from the pit, like the smoke of a furnace that is in blast; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
REV|9|3||And out of the smoke, came locusts upon the earth: and power was given them, like that which scorpions have on the earth.
REV|9|4||And it was commanded them, that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any herb, nor any tree; but [only] the persons, who had not the seal of God upon their foreheads.
REV|9|5||And it was given them, that they should not kill them, but should torment them five months: and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a person.
REV|9|6||And in those days, men will desire death, and will not find it; and they will long to die, and death will fly from them.
REV|9|7||And the appearance of the locusts [was this]; they were like the appearance of horses prepared for battle; and on their heads, was, as it were a coronet, resembling gold; and their faces were like the faces of men.
REV|9|8||And they had hair, like the hair of women: and their teeth were like those of lions.
REV|9|9||And they had breastplates, like breastplates of iron: and the sound of their wings, was like the sound of the chariots of many horses rushing into battle.
REV|9|10||And they had tails like those of scorpions, and stings; and with their tails they had the power of hurting men five months.
REV|9|11||And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss; and his name, in Hebrew, is Abaddon; and in Greek, his name is Apollyon.
REV|9|12||One woe is past; lo, there come yet two woes after them.
REV|9|13||And the sixth angel sounded; and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which was before God,
REV|9|14||that said to the sixth angel having a trumpet: Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.
REV|9|15||And the four angels were loosed; who are prepared, for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men.
REV|9|16||And the number of the warrior horsemen was two myriads of myriads: and I heard their number.
REV|9|17||And while I looked on the horses in the vision, and on them who sat on them [I saw] that the breastplates were of fire, and of jacinth, and of sulphur. And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and from their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and sulphur.
REV|9|18||And by these three plagues, a third part of the men were slain; [namely,] by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the sulphur, which issued from their mouths.
REV|9|19||For the power of the horses was in; their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails were like serpents, having heads to strike with.
REV|9|20||And the residue of men who were not slain by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which cannot see, nor hear.
REV|9|21||And they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their whoredom, nor of their thefts.
REV|10|1||And I saw another mighty angel, that descended from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a cloud-bow was over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
REV|10|2||And he had in his hand an open little book: and he placed his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the land:
REV|10|3||and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roareth: and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
REV|10|4||And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not.
REV|10|5||And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and the land, raised his right hand to heaven,
REV|10|6||and swore, by him who liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that the time should be no longer;
REV|10|7||but, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, and the mystery of God shall be consummated; as he announced to his servants the prophets.
REV|10|8||And the voice which I heard from heaven, spoke to me again, and said: Go, take the little open book in the hand of the angel that standeth on the sea and on the land.
REV|10|9||And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it: and it will make thy bowels bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.
REV|10|10||And I took the little book from the hand of the angel, and ate it: and it was in my mouth sweet like honey: and when I had eaten it, my bowels were bitter.
REV|10|11||And be said to me, Thou must again prophesy upon many nations, and peoples, and princes, and kings.
REV|11|1||And a reed was given to me, like a rod; and the angel stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
REV|11|2||But the court which is without the temple, leave out, and measure it not; because it is given to the Gentiles; and they will tread down the holy city forty and two months.
REV|11|3||And I will give my two witnesses; and they will prophesy a thousand and two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
REV|11|4||These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks which stand before the Lord of the earth.
REV|11|5||And if any person will harm them, fire cometh out of their mouth, and consumeth their adversary; and if any one will harm them, thus must he be slain.
REV|11|6||They have power to shut up heaven, so that the rain shall not fall in those days: and they have power over the waters, to turn them into blood; and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they please.
REV|11|7||And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast of prey that came up from the abyss, will make war upon them, and will overcome them.
REV|11|8||And their dead bodies [will be] in the open street of that great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
REV|11|9||And [they] of the nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, will look upon their dead bodies, three days and a half; and will not suffer their dead bodies to be laid in the grave.
REV|11|10||And they who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and will be merry, and will send presents to one another; because those two prophets tormented them who dwell on the earth.
REV|11|11||And after these three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell on those who saw them.
REV|11|12||And they heard a great voice from heaven, which said to them: Come up hither. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies saw them.
REV|11|13||And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell: and the persons killed in the earthquake, were seven thousand names: and they who remained were afraid, and gave glory to God.
REV|11|14||The second woe is passed: behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
REV|11|15||And the seventh angel sounded; and there were voices and thunders, which said: The kingdom of the world hath become [the kingdom] of our Lord and of his Messiah; and he will reign for ever and ever.
REV|11|16||And the twenty and four Elders, who are before the throne of God, [and] who sit upon their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
REV|11|17||saying: We praise thee, O Lord God, Omnipotent, who art, and wast; because thou hast assumed thy great power, and hast reigned.
REV|11|18||And the nations were angry; and thy anger is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged: and that thou shouldst give a reward to thy servants, the prophets, and the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and that thou shouldst destroy them who destroyed the earth.
REV|11|19||And the temple of God in heaven was opened; and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and thunders, and voices, and an earthquake, and great hail.
REV|12|1||And a great wonder was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a coronet of twelve stars.
REV|12|2||And, being with child, she cried, and travailed, and had the pangs of bringing forth.
REV|12|3||And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and lo, a great fiery dragon, which had seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems.
REV|12|4||And his tail drew along the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them on the earth. And the dragon was standing before the woman, who was about to bring forth, so that, when she should bring forth, he might devour her child.
REV|12|5||And she brought forth a male child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and to his throne.
REV|12|6||And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place which was prepared for her by God; so that they might nourish her there a thousand and two hundred and sixty days.
REV|12|7||And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought,
REV|12|8||and prevailed not; nor was their place found any more in heaven.
REV|12|9||And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent, who is called the Deceiver, and Satan, who seduceth all the inhabited world: he was cast upon the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
REV|12|10||And I heard a great voice in heaven, which said: Now is there deliverance, and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the dominion of his Messiah: because the Accuser of our brethren is cast out, who accused them day and night before our God.
REV|12|11||And they overcame him, because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony: and they loved not their life, even to death.
REV|12|12||Therefore, be joyful, O heaven, and ye that dwell there. Woe to the earth, and to the sea; for the Deceiver hath come down to you, being in great wrath since he knoweth that his time is short.
REV|12|13||And when the dragon saw that he was cast out upon the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child.
REV|12|14||And to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place; where she is nourished a time and times and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
REV|12|15||And the serpent ejected from his mouth waters like a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.
REV|12|16||And the earth helped the woman: and the earth opened its mouth, and drank up the flood which the serpent ejected from his mouth.
REV|12|17||And the dragon was enraged against the woman; and he went to make war upon the residue of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.
REV|13|1||And he stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast of prey come up from the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads; and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
REV|13|2||And the beast of prey which I saw, was like a leopard; and his feet like [those] of a wolf, and his mouth like the mouth of lions: and the dragon gave to him his own power and his throne, and great authority.
REV|13|3||And one of his heads was wounded as it were to death; and his deadly wound was healed. And all the earth wondered after the beast of prey.
REV|13|4||And they worshipped the dragon, because he had given authority to this beast of prey, and [they said], who can make war upon him?
REV|13|5||And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemies: and authority was given him to operate forty and two months.
REV|13|6||And he opened his mouth in blasphemy towards God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and them who dwell in heaven.
REV|13|7||And authority was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation: and it was given him to wage war with the saints, and to overcome them.
REV|13|8||And all that dwell on the earth, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, will worship him.
REV|13|9||If any one hath ears, let him hear.
REV|13|10||If [any one] carrieth into captivity, he shall himself go into captivity; and if any one slayeth with the sword, he must be slain with the sword: here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
REV|13|11||And I saw another beast of prey, which came out of the earth; and he had two horns like those of a lamb, and he spoke like the dragon.
REV|13|12||And before him he exercised all the authority of the first beast of prey, whose deadly wound was healed.
REV|13|13||And he wrought great signs, even so as to make fire come down from heaven upon the earth, before men.
REV|13|14||And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, to erect an image to the beast of prey who had the wound from a sword and recovered.
REV|13|15||And it was given him to put life into the image of the beast of prey; and to cause that all they who would not worship the image of the beast of prey, should be slain:
REV|13|16||and to cause that all, great and small, rich and poor, bond and free, should receive a mark on their right hands, or upon their foreheads;
REV|13|17||so that no one might be able to buy or to sell, except those who had the mark of the name of the beast of prey, or the number of his name.
REV|13|18||Here is wisdom: let him that hath intelligence, compute the number of the beast of prey; for it is the number of a man: and its number is six hundred and sixty and six.
REV|14|1||And I looked, and behold, a Lamb stood on mount Zion; and with him the number of a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written upon their foreheads.
REV|14|2||And I heard a sound from heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of great thunder; and the sound which I heard, was like that of harpers striking on their harps.
REV|14|3||And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four Animals and the Elders: and no one was able to learn that song, except the hundred and forty and four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.
REV|14|4||These are they who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are they who followed the Lamb, whithersoever he went. These have been redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and the Lamb.
REV|14|5||And in their mouth was found, no falsehood; for they are without faults.
REV|14|6||And I saw another angel flying in heaven: and with blood, he had the everlasting gospel, to proclaim to dwellers on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
REV|14|7||saying with a loud voice, Worship God, and give glory to him; because the hour of his judgment is come; and adore ye Him, who made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water.
REV|14|8||And another, a second angel followed him, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which made all nations drink of the wine of the rage of her whoredom.
REV|14|9||And another, a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any man shall worship the beast of prey and its image, and shall receive its mark upon his forehead or on his hand,
REV|14|10||he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured undiluted into the cup of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and sulphur, before the holy angels, and before the throne.
REV|14|11||And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever; and there is no rest, by day or by night, to those that worship the beast of prey and its image.
REV|14|12||Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
REV|14|13||And I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, henceforth: yes, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their toils; for their deeds do accompany them.
REV|14|14||And I looked, and lo, a white cloud; and upon the cloud sat one who was like the Son of man; and on his head was a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
REV|14|15||And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice, to him that sat on the cloud.
REV|14|16||And he thrust his sickle over the earth; and the earth was reaped.
REV|14|17||And another angel came out of the temple that is in heaven, having also a sharp sickle.
REV|14|18||And another angel came out from the altar, having authority over fire. And he cried with a loud voice, to him who had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sickle which is sharp, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes of the earth are ripe.
REV|14|19||And the angel thrust in his sickle on the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast [it] into the wine-press of the wrath of the great God.
REV|14|20||And the wine-press was trodden, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
REV|15|1||And I saw another prodigy in heaven, great and wonderful; seven angels, having seven plagues, the last in order, because with them the wrath of God is consummated.
REV|15|2||And I saw as it were, a sea of glass mixed with fire: and they, who had been victorious over the beast of prey, and over its image, and over the number of its name, were standing on the sea of glass; and they had the harps of God.
REV|15|3||And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and marvellous are thy deeds, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, O King of worlds.
REV|15|4||Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? Because thou only art holy and just: Because all nations shall come and worship before thee, since thy righteousnesses have been revealed.
REV|15|5||And after this I beheld, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven, was opened.
REV|15|6||And the seven angels who had the seven plagues, went forth from the temple, clothed in clean splendid linen, and girded about their breast with girdles of gold.
REV|15|7||And one of the four Animals gave to those seven angels seven cups of gold, full of the wrath of God who liveth for ever and ever.
REV|15|8||And the temple was filled with smoke, from the glory of God and from his power; and no one was able to enter the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were accomplished.
REV|16|1||And I heard a voice, which said to the seven angels: Go forth, and pour those seven cups of the wrath of God upon the earth.
REV|16|2||And the first went, and poured his cup upon the earth; and there was a malignant and painful ulcer upon those men who had the mark of the beast of prey, and who worshipped its image.
REV|16|3||And the second angel poured his cup upon the sea; and it became blood, like that of a dead person; and every living soul of things in the sea, died.
REV|16|4||And the third angel poured his cup upon the rivers and the fountains of water; and they became blood.
REV|16|5||And I heard the angel of the waters say: Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, and art holy; because thou hast done this judgment.
REV|16|6||For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets; and thou hast given them blood to drink, for they deserve it.
REV|16|7||And I heard [one from] the altar say: Yes, Lord God Almighty: true and righteous is thy judgment.
REV|16|8||And the fourth poured his cup upon the sun: and it was permitted him, to scorch men with fire.
REV|16|9||And men were scorched with great heat; and men blasphemed the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues; and they repented not, to give glory to him.
REV|16|10||And the fifth poured his cup on the throne of the beast of prey; and his kingdom became darkness; and they gnawed their tongues, from pain;
REV|16|11||and they blasphemed the God of heaven, on account of their pains and their ulcers, and did not repent of their deeds.
REV|16|12||And the sixth poured his cup upon the great river Euphrates; and its waters dried up, so that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.
REV|16|13||And I saw [issuing] from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the beast of prey, and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs:
REV|16|14||(for they are the spirits of demons, who work prodigies;) and they go forth to all the kings of all the habitable world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty.
REV|16|15||(And lo, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments; lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)
REV|16|16||And they collected them together in a place called, in Hebrew, Armageddon.
REV|16|17||And the seventh poured his cup on the air; and there issued a loud voice from the temple, from the throne, which said: It is done!
REV|16|18||And there were lightnings, and thunders, and voices; and there was a great earthquake, the like of which there was never, since men were on the earth, such an earthquake, and so great.
REV|16|19||And the great city became three parts. And the city of the nations fell; and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the heat of his wrath.
REV|16|20||And every island fled away; and the mountains were not found.
REV|16|21||And a great hail, as it were of a talent weight, fell from heaven upon men: and the men blasphemed God, on account of the plague of hail; for the plague of it was very great.
REV|17|1||Then came one of the seven angels who have the seven cups, and talked with me, saying: Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters;
REV|17|2||with whom the kings of the earth have practised whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth have been inebriated with the wine of her whoredom.
REV|17|3||And he led me in spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting on a red beast of prey, which was full of names of blasphemy, and had seven heads and ten horns.
REV|17|4||And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stones, and pearls; and she had a cup of gold in her hand, which was full of the pollutions and impurity of her whoredoms of the earth.
REV|17|5||And upon her forehead was the name written: Mystery: Babylon the great; the Mother of Harlots, and of the contaminations of the Earth.
REV|17|6||And I saw that the woman was intoxicated with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.
REV|17|7||And the Angel said to me, Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast of prey that beareth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
REV|17|8||The beast of prey which thou sawest, was, and is not; and he will ascend from the abyss and go into perdition: and the dwellers on the earth, whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast of prey, which was, and is not, and approacheth.
REV|17|9||Here is intelligence, for him who hath wisdom. Those seven heads are the seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
REV|17|10||And there are seven kings: of whom five have fallen, one exists, and the other hath not yet come; and when he cometh he must continue for a short time.
REV|17|11||And the beast of prey, which was and is not, is the eighth, and is from the seven, and is for perdition.
REV|17|12||And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings. These persons have not yet received royalty; but they receive authority, as if kings, with the beasts of prey, for one hour.
REV|17|13||They have one mind; and they will give their power and authority unto the beast of prey.
REV|17|14||They will make war upon the Lamb; and the Lamb will vanquish them; because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and these with him [are] called and chosen and faithful.
REV|17|15||And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
REV|17|16||And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast of prey, will hate the harlot; and they will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
REV|17|17||For God hath put into their hearts, to do his pleasure, and to execute one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast of prey, until these words of God shall be fulfilled.
REV|17|18||And the woman whom thou sawest, is the great city, which hath dominion over the kings of the earth.
REV|18|1||After these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven; and he had great authority and the earth was illumined by his glory.
REV|18|2||And he cried with a strong voice, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great: and hath become a cavern of demons, and the home of every unclean spirit, and the home of every unclean and hateful bird and the home of every unclean and hateful beast of prey.
REV|18|3||For all the nations have drunken of the wine of her wrath; and the kings of the earth have practised whoredom with her; and the merchants of the earth have been enriched by the abundance of her luxuries.
REV|18|4||And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: Come ye out of her, my people; that ye may not participate in her sins, and may not partake of her plagues.
REV|18|5||For her sins have reached up to heaven; and God hath remembered her iniquities.
REV|18|6||Recompense ye to her, as she also hath recompensed; and render to her double, according to her deeds; in the cup which she hath mixed, mix ye to her two fold.
REV|18|7||As much as she pleased herself with lasciviousness, so much of anguish and sorrow give ye to her. Because she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I shall see no sorrow;
REV|18|8||therefore, in one day, shall these her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
REV|18|9||And the kings of the earth who committed whoredom and were lascivious with her, shall weep, and mourn, and bewail her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
REV|18|10||standing afar off, from fear of her torment, [and] saying, Alas, alas! that great city Babylon, that powerful city; for in one hour is thy judgment come!
REV|18|11||And the merchants of the earth will mourn over her, because no one purchaseth their cargo;
REV|18|12||no more, the cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and every aromatic wood, and all vessels of ivory, and all vessels of very precious wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble,
REV|18|13||and cinnamon, and amomum, and aromatics, and unguents, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts of burden, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and the bodies and souls of men.
REV|18|14||And the fruits which thy soul desired, have departed from thee; and all things delicious and splendid have perished from thee; and the traders in them shall obtain them no more.
REV|18|15||And they who were enriched from her, will stand afar off, for fear of her torment; and will weep and mourn,
REV|18|16||saying: Alas, alas! that great city, which was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stones, and pearls; because, in one hour, such riches are laid waste.
REV|18|17||And every pilot, and every navigator to the place, and the sailors, and all who do business by sea) stood afar off,
REV|18|18||and cried, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying: What [other] is like this great city!
REV|18|19||And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping, and mourning, and saying: Alas, alas that great city, in which all that have ships in the sea became rich, by her preciousness; for in one hour she hath become desolate.
REV|18|20||Rejoice over her, O heaven, and ye Angels, and Legates, and Prophets; because God judgeth your cause with her.
REV|18|21||And an angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: So shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and shall no more be found:
REV|18|22||and the voice of harpers and musicians and pipers and trumpeters, shall no more be heard in thee; and no artificer of any trade, shall be found any more in thee.
REV|18|23||And the light of a candle, shall not be seen in thee; and the voice of a bridegroom and bride, shall no more be heard in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, because all nations were seduced by thy sorceries.
REV|18|24||And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all those that have been slain on the earth.
REV|19|1||And after these things, I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying: Hallelujah: Deliverance, and strength, and glory, and honor, unto our God:
REV|19|2||for, true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged that great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her whoredom; and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
REV|19|3||And again they said: Hallelujah: and her smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever.
REV|19|4||And the twenty-four Elders fell down, and the four Animals, and worshipped God who sitteth on the throne, saying: Amen: Hallelujah!
REV|19|5||And a voice came forth from the throne, saying: Praise our God, all ye his servants; and such as fear him, small and great.
REV|19|6||And I heard, as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of heavy thunders, saying: Hallelujah; for our Lord God, Omnipotent, reigneth.
REV|19|7||Let us rejoice and exult, and give glory to him: for the marriage supper of the Lamb hath come, and his bride hath made herself ready.
REV|19|8||And it was granted her to be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean: for fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.
REV|19|9||And he said to me, Write; Blessed are they who are called to the supper of the marriage feast of the Lamb. And he said to me, These my [sayings] are the true words of God.
REV|19|10||And I fell at his feet, to worship him. And he said to me, See, [thou do it] not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of those thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship ye God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
REV|19|11||And I saw heaven opened: and lo, a white horse; and he that sat on it, is called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judgeth, and maketh war.
REV|19|12||His eyes [were] like a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many diadems; and he had names inscribed; and the name which was written on him, no one knew, except himself.
REV|19|13||And he was clothed with a vesture sprinkled with blood; and his name is called, The Word of God.
REV|19|14||And the soldiery of heaven followed him, on white horses, clad in garments of fine linen, pure [and] white.
REV|19|15||And from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he could smite the nations; and he will rule the nations with a rod of iron; and he will tread the wine-press of the wrath of God Almighty.
REV|19|16||And he hath upon his vesture and upon his thigh the words written: King of kings, and Lord of lords.
REV|19|17||And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven: Come ye, assemble unto this great supper of God;
REV|19|18||that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of valiant men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all the free-born and of slaves, and of the small and the great.
REV|19|19||And I saw the beast of prey, and the kings of the earth, and their warriors, that they assembled to wage battle with him who sat on the [white] horse, and with his warriors.
REV|19|20||And the beast of prey was captured, and the false prophet that was with him, who did those prodigies before him, whereby he seduced them who had received the mark of the beast of prey and who worshipped his image. And they were both cast alive into the lake of fire, which burneth with sulphur.
REV|19|21||And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat on the horse, by that [sword] which issueth from his mouth: and all the fowls were satiated with their flesh.
REV|20|1||And I saw an angel that descended from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
REV|20|2||And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, who is the Deceiver and Satan, who seduced the whole habitable world: and he bound him a thousand years.
REV|20|3||And he cast him into the abyss, and closed and sealed upon him; so that he might deceive the nations no more, until these thousand years shall be completed: but after that, he will be loosed for a little time.
REV|20|4||And I saw thrones, and [persons] sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and to the souls that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God: and these are they who had not worshipped the beast of prey, nor its image, neither had they received the mark upon their forehead or on their hand, and they lived and reigned with their Messiah those thousand years.
REV|20|5||This is the first resurrection.
REV|20|6||Blessed and holy is he that hath part in this first resurrection: over them the second death hath no dominion; but they shall be, [nay] are, priests of God and of his Messiah; and they will reign with him the thousand years.
REV|20|7||And when these thousand years shall be completed, Satan will be released from his prison;
REV|20|8||and will go forth to seduce the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog; and to assemble them for battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.
REV|20|9||And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven, and consumed them.
REV|20|10||And the Accuser who seduced them, was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where also were the beast of prey and the false prophet: and they shall be tormented, day and night, for ever and ever.
REV|20|11||And I saw a great white throne, and Him who sitteth thereon; from whose presence the earth and heaven fled away, and this their place was not found.
REV|20|12||And I saw the dead, great and small standing before the throne; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life. And the dead were judged from the things written in the books, according to their deeds.
REV|20|13||And the sea gave up the dead in it; and death and the grave gave up the dead in them. And they were judged, each one according to his deeds.
REV|20|14||And death and the grave were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, [namely,] this lake of fire.
REV|20|15||And if any one was not found enrolled in the book of life, he was cast into this lake of fire.
REV|21|1||And I saw new heavens, and a new earth: for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away: and the sea was no more.
REV|21|2||And I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
REV|21|3||And I heard a great voice from heaven, which said: Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men; and he dwelleth with them: they will be his people; and God will be with them, a God to them.
REV|21|4||And every tear will be wiped from their eyes; and there will no more be death, nor mourning, nor wailing; nor shall pain be any more; because the former things are passed away.
REV|21|5||And He who sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all things new. And he said: Write; because these are the faithful and true words of God.
REV|21|6||And he said to me: I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Completion: to him who thirsteth, will I give of the fountain of living water, gratis.
REV|21|7||He that overcometh, shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
REV|21|8||But to the timid, and the unbelieving, and to the sinful, and polluted, and to manslayers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and to all false persons, their portion shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.
REV|21|9||And there came one of those seven angels, who have the seven cups filled with the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying: Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
REV|21|10||And he bore me away in the spirit, to a mountain great and high, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God;
REV|21|11||in which was the glory of God, as a brilliant light, and resembling a very precious gem; like a jasper stone, resembling crystal.
REV|21|12||And it had a wall great and lofty, which had twelve gates, and names inscribed on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
REV|21|13||On the east, three gates; on the north, three gates; [on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates].
REV|21|14||And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and upon them the twelve names of the twelve legates of the Lamb.
REV|21|15||And he that talked with me, had a measure, a golden reed; so that he could measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.
REV|21|16||And the city stood up four square; and its length was the same as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, to twelve furlongs of twelve thousand; and the length and the breadth and the height of it were [all] equal.
REV|21|17||And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty and four measures of the cubits of a man, that is, of the angel.
REV|21|18||And the structure of its wall [was of] jasper; and the city was of pure gold, like pure glass.
REV|21|19||And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation, a jasper; the second, a sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
REV|21|20||the fifth, a sardonyx; the sixth, a sardius; the seventh, a chrysolite; the eighth, a beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
REV|21|21||And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; each [pearl] one gate, and each [gate] one pearl: and the broad street of the city was pure gold, like brilliant glass.
REV|21|22||And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.
REV|21|23||And the city hath no need of the sun or of the moon, to enlighten it; for the glory of God enlighteneth it, and the Lamb is the lamps of it.
REV|21|24||And the nations that were saved, shall walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory and the wealth of the nations into it.
REV|21|25||And its gates shall not be shut by day; for there is no night there.
REV|21|26||And they will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
REV|21|27||And there shall not enter it, any thing polluted, or that practiseth impurity and falsehood; but they who are registered in the Lamb's book of life.
REV|22|1||And he showed me a river of living water, transparent [as] crystal, which proceeded from the throne of God and the Lamb.
REV|22|2||And in the middle of its broad avenue, and near the river, on this side and on that, [was] the tree of life; which bore twelve [sorts of] fruits yielding one of its fruits each month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.
REV|22|3||And there will be no blight any more: and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in it; and his servants will minister to him.
REV|22|4||And they will see his face, and his name [will be] on their foreheads.
REV|22|5||And there will be no more night; and they have no need of the light of a candle, or of the light of the sun; because the Lord God giveth them light: and they will reign for ever and ever.
REV|22|6||And he said to me: These words [are] faithful and true. And the Lord God of the spirit of the prophets, hath sent me, his angel, to show unto his servants the things that must soon occur.
REV|22|7||And, lo, I come quickly: Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
REV|22|8||And more-over I am John, the hearer and the seer of these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
REV|22|9||And he said to me: See, [thou do it] not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them that observe the words of this book. Worship God.
REV|22|10||And he said to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is near.
REV|22|11||He that doth evil, let him do evil still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him practise righteousness still; and he that is sanctified, let him be sanctified still.
REV|22|12||Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to recompense every one according to his work.
REV|22|13||I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Commencement and the Completion.
REV|22|14||Blessed are they who do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.
REV|22|15||Without [will be] dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and manslayers, and idolaters, and every one that loveth and doeth falsehood.
REV|22|16||I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify to you these things before the churches. I am the root and offspring of David: like the splendid star of the morning.
REV|22|17||And the Spirit and the bride say, Come thou. And let him that heareth, say, Come thou. And let him who thirsteth, come; and he that is inclined, let him take the living water gratis.
REV|22|18||I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, that if any one shall add to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
REV|22|19||And if any one shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion from the tree of life, and from the holy city, which are described in this book.
REV|22|20||He who testifieth these things, saith: Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
REV|22|21||The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, [be] with all the saints. Amen.
